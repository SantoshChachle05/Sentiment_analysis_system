# 🛒 Sentiment Analysis for FMCG Products using NLP

This project implements a **Sentiment Analysis System** for **FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods)** products using traditional **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. It processes customer reviews, feedback, and product-related text to classify sentiment as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** — helping businesses understand customer perceptions and improve decision-making.
