1188092,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"The Vicks Nursery 1 Gallon Vaporizer with Night-Light Warm Steam Vaporizer works great and easy to use. However, there is no adjustable feature. It only stops if it runs out of water/fluid or you unplug.",1,2022

1188105,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"If your desperate for relief this will help. But dont expect it to last long. The decals started rubbing off almost Immediately. A bit overpriced for the quality, if you ask me. Youre better off buying the larger tank.",1,2022
1188106,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,It steamed its best for me with kosher salt,1,2022
1188107,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,Works. It indeed raises the humidity level of an area. One issue I have is to thoroughly remove the accumulated crud on the body of the steam emitter unit as the only means I see to do this is to disassemble the unit and remove the blue cover. Nonetheless I do not believe this step is recommended.,1,2022
1188108,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"The vapor is minimal, it doesn`t help at all. Plus: there is a big green light that will not let you sleep.",1,2022
1188109,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"I have used these humidifiers before and think they do a good job for the price-point. To avoid having to go in-store, I ordered this online for delivery. Received it today and Canadian Tire sent me a used one. There was residual water in the reservoir, as well as flaked-off mineral buildup that only happens when a humidifier has been used. Not cool, Canadian Tire. Buyers, beware.",1,2022

1188121,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,Love the humidifier- I have 3- 2 started leaking at different times- went to clean them and BOTH have cracks in the acrylic in SAME place so it leaks! One leak is slow so we had been placing a pan underneath- the other leaks SO much it's not usable! I am so disappointed! It must be a manufacture defect in this part of the acrylic for them both to have cracks in same place. Otherwise I WAS happy with them but won't be buying this one again!,1,2022
1188123,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,This really helped me a lot,1,2022

1188164,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"I heat with wood from time to time, especially when its very cold, its drier in the bedroom, so it picks up humidity and its great with the machine.",1,2022

1188235,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,The vaporizer is easy to use and it helps with my sinuses and my throat. I would recommend it to anyone having sinusitis or allergies.,1,2022
1188236,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"We`ve been using Honeywell humidifiers for years but they can be pricey and high-maintenance, so I decided to give this one a try. It has only one setting and no On-Off switch, so I can`t give it full marks but it does what it does well. The reservoir is large enough to last for two nights and the steam output is just right for a medium-size bedroom, and it`s also quite quiet.",1,2022
1188237,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I use this to humidify the home in winter It raises the humidity of the house into the comfort zone and keeps it there warm mist is safer than cool because there`s no biohazard This one has good features and an operating light Safe heat guard so you can`t touch the hot steam outlet by mistake Runs a long time on one fill ... Shuts off when empty automatically,1,2022
1188240,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,You should know that the what last 12 hour when on high,1,2022

1188252,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,First: Critical thinking...to those of you who experienced a &amp;quot;LEMON&amp;quot; stop complaining,1,2022
1188258,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"It is constantly showing as invalid and I have to dump all the water that collects in the bottom, unplug it and repeat the same steps over and over again. Some sort of weird film has built up which cannot easily be scr off and it gets everywhere. Doesnt seem productive for easing breathing symptoms. I hate this thing",1,2022
1188259,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"Works well enough for what its intended for. I bought this so I could have something on my nightstand. The only issue I have with it is that there is no on/off button anywhere on it so to turn it on/off you have to unplug the entire thing. And if the outlet is in a hard to reach place (mine happens to be) it becomes quite a hassle to turn on and off, unless you want the thing running 24/7.",1,2022
1188266,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,Works as anticipated,1,2022
1188273,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,I bought this item to help my baby breathe better throughout the nights because she gets congested and this did not work at all. Couldn`t even smell the vicks. Very disappointed,1,2022
1188274,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I just wanted to try this product with my humidifier,1,2022
1188275,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"Smell really bad, like cleaning products. It make my coughing got worse. Not recomend this product.",1,2022
1188278,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Even though it has a small tank; the steam lasts all night in a 200 sq. ft. room.,1,2022
1188279,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Got this a day earlier, easy setup and works great. Day 1!",1,2022
1188282,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"The filter does what it is supposed to do, remove minerals from the tap water, hence reducing white dust throughout the house. Probably last about a month with just nightime use. Cheaper than using distilled water.",1,2022
1188296,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"If the humidifier is above your head within a few inches diameter from you, you may get the benefit of the humidifier. Otherwise, all of the mist just settles beneath it - it doesnt disseminate throughout the roomIts also fairly loud when the water moves into the chamber. This happens every 20 minutes or so, so you hear the bubbling of it moving.Other than that, its nice. The pics on the ceiling are a nice touch and they automatically cycle.",1,2022
1188297,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"There is barely any mist that comes from this humidifier, and I`ve only used it a few times, and 1. the mist is so scarce you can barely see it 2. this humidifier makes no difference. I would invest In a better one if I could go back",1,2022
1188307,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Legit &amp; easy to use, just drop in! :)",1,2022
1188308,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I used the product to help moisten the air in our room which was extremely dry and causing my husband nose bleeds. It has helped greatly.,1,2022
1188309,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Everything is goo its still working great,1,2022
1188312,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,"1. it says, don`t use boiling water, just hot water from the tap. That doesn`t produce good enough steam to inhale.2.. The &amp;quot;mask&amp;quot; is rigid and doesn`t fit well to seal around the face/nose.3. The manual of the apparatus and Vicks pads say, literary, &amp;quot;Use me&amp;quot;. What is that - &amp;quot;Alice in wonderland&amp;quot;?",1,2022
1188322,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,Previous humidifiers were stronger. I even called to complain of brochure. 1 line or 2 lines- which is stronger.,1,2022
1188325,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Amazon recommends buying this to use with a Pure Enrichment MistAire Ultrasonic Cool Mist Humidifier. This is an error. It is too big to fit into the fill hole in the reservoir.,1,2022
1188330,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,The right price not too heavy when full of water...just what we needed. Low maintenance.,1,2022

1188360,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Tad noisey, but to be expected (like a white noise so not really a problem)Good tank size, lasts all night regardless of setting",1,2022
1188361,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,This works great super easy to fill and very quiet has helped me alot,1,2022
1188362,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Awesome humidifier. I have had this running almost constantly for over a week now, and it just keeps going. My 3 year old knows how to fill it (but he needs help to actually fill it), when to fill it, and how to work it. I love that you can adjust the intensity of the mist and that you can add the vapor pads. Made a huge difference when my son had a cough and I ran it overnight in his room - plus it is so quiet. The noise it does make is like white noise, versus a mechanical/electrical noise. It will run for 8 hours at least on high setting. I just wish I could order a couple more for other rooms as well.",1,2022
1188365,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,Takes a while to warm up. Moderate steam generated. The scents are weak,1,2022
1188366,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Great for this with allergies or breathing troubles,1,2022
1188377,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"I like the humidifier, but I would like it better if there was some kind of filter to stop the buildup of minerals on the heating element. That part is very hard to clean.",1,2022
1188383,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Worthless - stopped working after a year.,1,2022
1188412,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Stopped working after a month. Ran water everywhere.,1,2022
1188426,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Or household got Covid and my 5 month old son has been struggling with nasal congestion. Since hes too young for traditional medications, weve leaned on the VapoPads for helping him breathe at night. As much as the price seems exorbitant, theyve been priceless for how much relief theyve given him. Well be keeping a supply on-hand at all times until hes old enough for the regular Vicks rub.",1,2022
1188444,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Si me agrada .,1,2022

1188451,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Totally silent, doesn`t take up much room, easy to clean and fill. Just what we wanted. Have not had it long, so do not its reliability, but it looks good.",1,2022
1188470,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,I bought the Aqua Oasis humidifier. When I saw it on Amazon it recommended I buy this to keep my humidifier tank clean inside. I thought it was as great idea and I thought it would kinda cute to have. I received the humidifier yesterday and I got everything out and read the directions and looked things over. I start to realize that this fish isnt going to fit in the opening of the tank. There was NO WAY this product was getting in this tank what so ever!! If your going to recommend a product along with another make sure it can be used together. Im really disappointed! I dont know how or who makes these recommendations but it needs to be fixed. I know its a small thing but it could happen on a bigger purchase for someone else. I gave it to my sister so she could use it in her humidifier.,1,2022
1188471,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,I obviously did not read enough about this before spending my money. It is literally a enclosed plastic cup that you lay the vics pad in and add hot water to. There was no benefit for me and I could have breathed over a hot cup of water for free!! I wish I had not wasted my money!! I don`t know how this is considered a steamer there was no steam.,1,2022
1188476,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"This product is a waste of money. The top is not well fitting and it doesn`t do what it should. I couldn`t smell the vapors, I had to hold the unit right up to my nose to even smell it. I think a plug in air freshener would provide a stronger smell. Don`t bother with this.",1,2022

1188498,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Not working and steam is not coming even after putting salt as it is said on the label,1,2022
1188507,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,it did great adding humidity to the air but ever couple of minutes it sents an air buble through the tank that is super noisy. it makes it impossible to sleep with in your bedroom. maybe better in a different room in the house,1,2022
1188522,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"It`s great, works well, very quiet. Be prepared to fill it at least once a day or more depending how you have it set.",1,2022
1188524,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Works as advertised, thanks.",1,2022
1188531,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Bought what I thought was a new product. When I received it the box was damaged. Took the unit out and it had used Vicks pads still in it.,1,2022
1188542,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Barely smelled,1,2022
1188549,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"I have a smaller Pure humidifier in my son`s nursery with a twist off opening at the bottom which wasn`t wide enough to get the fish in. Otherwise, I think it would`ve worked great. Will be exchanging for a smaller option",1,2022
1188550,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Ive used these for years to maintain the quality of the humidifiers water. I still use distilled water. This fish design is difficult to find, and expensive, but it definitely keeps the distilled water free from scale and slime and eliminates hard water build up. Whether you have a replacement filter or not, this is a good addition to maintain the distilled water.",1,2022
1188552,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"It fit perfectly, and it works great in humidifying the air in our small Vicks humidifier.",1,2022

1188573,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Used one of these last year and I`m convinced it helped keep my humidifier cleaner longer. Plus it`s so dang cute! All my friends get a hoot out of coming to see my &amp;quot;aquarium!&amp;quot;,1,2022
1188574,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"Same problem as everyone else, I foolishly believed it would work with a humidifier as pictured but instead it is too large and when I applied any force to try and squeeze it in it immediately popped open and spilled the little balls everywhere. Waste of money, shouldnt have bought it",1,2022
1188575,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,"Like many reviewers, my unit stopped working after 3 weeks. I registered for a warranty online (get info off the box) and they are sending me a replacement. This seems to be the best solution for the issues with this product. Hopefully the second one will work longer but I`ll keep getting replacements if it continues to happen.",1,2022

1188577,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Each of us in our family have allergies and us this humidifier at night works wonders. I sleep so much better. Both my daughters are married and they now have purchased the exact same humidifier. They find they sleep much better and their allergies are not acting up. My husband even has a separate one in his bedroom. what a great humifier. It`s easy to use, clean, setup and quiet as a mouse at night when you sleep.",1,2022
1188578,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"If you need a nebulizer or steam therapy, youve come to the wrong place. The design of this thing in no way produces steam. Its trash and will just add to landfill around the world. You are better off putting a pot of boiling water on the stove and inhaling the steam for a few minutes. This is a cheaply made, useless and deceiving contraption.",1,2022
1188585,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"BURNT Hand!Please read this before buying. Avoid this product. The design is the worst in todays time! Hot scalding water is not contained properly. This has caused a 2nd degree burn on one hand after a slight tilt poured hot burning liquid on my hand.Have reached out to CPSC to ban this product. Very dangerous with kids around. For your safety and your dear ones, avoid this. Go buy a cold water vapor system.Legal action will follow.Highly irresponsible of the company to continue this product design.Wont post gross burn pics here but I have documented the pics to present to CPSC.",1,2022

1188601,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"Puts out very little vapour, it takes my room from 20%RH to 30% If Im lucky. Plus you cant turn the green night light out. Spend a little more and get something better.",1,2022

1188630,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,great service and communication A++++++,1,2022
1188637,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Keeping mould and other things from growing in humidifiers water tanks is a challenge. I was sceptical that these would work. I was wrong. These really do the job.,1,2022
1188649,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,I bought this humidifier and it worked wonderful the first day. The second day it leaked out from every crevice. I had put a towel under the humidifier and the towel was saturated within a few hours. It stained my wooden table. Very disappointed and I returned it right away.,1,2022

1188652,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"I have been waiting for this for weeks, they were out of stock, so I finally got it couple days ago and I had bought an equivalent at the local brick and mortar store, unfortunately the equivalent version gave off a strange acetone smell in the water, so I just threw it away. This Vicks humidifier, is silent, non-smelly, and humidifies. It is one of five humidifiers that I have in the living room, and I love that it is so cheap, so useful, so perfect for a dry room in the winter. I earlier had bought an evaporative humidifier not knowing that it would actually lower the temperature in the winter and actually make it colder and chillier. So now that I have this Vicks vaporizer, with the hygrometer in front of me so I can see the change, it is effective and it does not make the room colder. I cannot recommend it enough. So happy I got this. Unbelievable at the price.",1,2022
1188653,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,"Other then the light on and noise, idk if this is really working. Little to no steam.???",1,2022

1188715,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Bought for a bedroom, since the house is heated with forced hot air, causing very low humidity levels. My main concern was ease of cleaning and thus far I`ve had no problems cleaning the unit. I am using distilled water which seems to lessen the frequency of cleanings.During the initial few days there was a constant gurgling sound occurring every few minutes. First impressions were &amp;quot;this is going to be difficult to sleep with&amp;quot;. After a week or so, the gurgling had ceased; the only sound after six+ weeks of ownership is the release of the mist which does not interfere with sleep.The unit performs quite well in a medium sized bedroom and increases the room moisture to an adequate level. Would recommend.",1,2022

1188742,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"This is the third humidifier I`ve used over the years and so far it`s the best. It`s small which is perfect for my needs. Some ppl find it difficult to clean but I don`t. I firmly press some packaging tape over the hole in the top, turn it upside down and fill the space with white vinegar and let it set for 20 min or so. I`ve never had any mold or mildew with this machine. It`s quiet as well so I can sleep w/o any problem.",1,2022

1188757,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"I was ordering a humidifier. Amazon suggested I buy 3 products at the same time. So, I did. This was one of the products as were 2 humidifiers. When I recieved them I found this would not go in either one. I could not return it because I had to destroy the packaging and I had thrown the packaging away a day before I had I was setting up my new humidifiers",1,2022
1188759,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"This unit is an inexpensive piece of garbage. It ran three time, now it leaks from the water tank from both the o-ring area as well as the rubber stopper in the bottom. Woke up to a nightstand dripping with water and an empty tank.",1,2022
1188776,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Excellent little humidifier. Ive had this on all night and with a full tank it lasted through 10 hours with 1/3 of the water still left. I love that you can control how much moisture is released and that you can see the vapor. I ran mine between 50% and 80% last night, fluctuating depending on my amount of congestion. Because it is a filterless machine, there is one less thing to worry about with maintenance.",1,2022
1188779,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Works great! It really helps you breath better at night,1,2022

1188783,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,I love the compact size and the scent of Vicks really helped open my nasal passages when I was sick and congested. The only con: there is no on/off button. You must unplug unit completely when you don't want to have it on.,1,2022

1188800,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"Works ok I guess. I cant tell if it is making any difference. Visible steam may depend on how hard your water is, hence adding salt. My issue is that it is bulky and clunky and mostly that there is no easy way to get all the water and debris out. (it accumulates black debris from hard water minerals).",1,2022

I typically need to refill it daily. Small unit, good for bedroom. Low setting is fine for a small room, but larger rooms need the high setting. This will not work well for a large living room area, though. Ive had mine for years with no leaking. I noticed that when cleaned with chemicals you will smell the residual chemicals during the next use. (Because of the heater in it maybe?) Not with soap &amp; water, though.",1,2022
1188855,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,I could not wait to get this item but it does not stay working and one of the things it says to do is to add salt to the water... Be careful it will boil but then this only lasts a few minutes and then it`s back to not producing any steam.,1,2022

It does NOT work at all as advertised and it does NOT keep my filters clean for any longer than with out one of these useless cartidges. What a complete waste of money!! FALSE advertising!!! I am VERY disappointed!!!,1,2022
1188868,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"I read mixed reviews about this little vaporizer and decided to give it a try for it being less than $20. So glad I did!! It works great, it really smells once the unit gets warmed up and makes a difference. I can smell it throughout my whole room. I love how theres also many different type of pads you can use with it, not just for when youre sick. It will work better when you have more humidity in your air per the box, so maybe the people complaining dont have enough humidity. I loved it so much I bought 2 more. Great product!",1,2022
1188869,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,I liked the value of the 3 pack. When I opened the box and removed the first filter there was a definite odor. I ran my humidifier and the odor permeated the room. I feel in time the odor will dissipate.,1,2022
1188872,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,The older models were of better quality. The plastic is very cheap. The reservoir for the Vicks steam is too big and doesnt work like the former model.,1,2022
1188877,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,A year ago I bought 3 of those. They were exactly what I was looking for - big enough for large bedrooms and had a wide opening for easy cleaning. One by one they started being super noisy and one by one just stopped working.,1,2022

I am 100% dissatisfied and will Be returning it to the store.,1,2022
1188916,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"I have used Vicks vaporizers for years and been happy. I am very disappointed in this one. It emits the most pitiful bit of steam and I saw NO difference in the air. I added about half a teaspoon of salt but the difference was minimal. I would take it back for a refund and get something else, but it seems ALL the new ones are made like this so it would not be better. I went back to boiling a pan of water on the stove!

1188928,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,This humidifier is not for everyone:1. It makes loud boiling sound and it`s not suited for night time during sleep2. The cord gets very very hot which is inline with the manual saying do not leave this unattended and it could cause fire3. It requires salt to start going4. It requires 10 to 20 minutes to start producing steam5. It is not to be left alone as per manual6. You cannot use just distilled water you have to mix one part regular water otheriwse no steamI really do not understand why this product is on the market. I`ll return and buy an ultrasonic one I had years ago ultra quiet and as I`ll be fine with cold mist.,1,2022

Since they are inexpensive, maybe that`s okay, but it`s a shame to put so much plastic in the trash. If Vick`s would just sell replacement heating rods, it would be much more environmentally friendly. Also, the advice in the manual to soak the parts in vinegar once a week doesn`t do any good, for me at least. I have to take the heater assembly apart every two weeks to clean out the heat chamber or it clogs up with gray flakes of crud (from the heat rods). Looks to me like these units are engineered to last only one winter season. What a shame.",1,2022

1189303,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,This is the second one I have owned. This humidifier works great in the winter when you don`t want the cool mist to make you feel like its getting colder. the built in Vicks scent things works really good as well. One thing to note though is definitely clean it since the place where it warms up can get crusty if you don`t maintain and clean it. Works great and would recommend.,1,2022
1189304,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Works well!,1,2022
1189333,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,"The concept is great. It doesn`t produce alot of steam, it doesn`t hold much water, constantly get burned by it (no mater how much water I put in) and all around is not worth the money. I`ve had it for almost a year and it`s just as worthless today as it was then.",1,2022

1189336,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I bought this for my newborn baby. This doesnt make loud noise and doesnt disturb my baby when hes asleep. Easy to use and easy to clean. Good for any size of bedroom.I highly recommend this product.,1,2022

1189400,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"Doesnt leave a layer of condensation on anything. I deducted a star because of the noise and light.

1189410,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"It is very very easy to tip this item over and get burned. This is sad because the design is otherwise great. Unfortunately in a home or office with cats, children, or even just clumsy humans this humidifier is not a good idea. Even 10 minutes with this item would horrify any company who cared about their customers. I`m pretty sure the company could easily fix this. Its simple. MAKE IT SO THE ITEM DOES NOT BREAK OPEN AND SPILL BURNING HOT WATER IF IT GETS KNOCKED ON THE FLOOR. Yes I have completely closed it. Design it better next time!",1,2022
1189411,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Very Easy to use and effective. All done in 10 mins. Very easy to clean. The holes in the mask makes it easy to breath while doing nasal. Also can easily control the speed of steam. Happy so far with the product,1,2022
1189413,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Highly recommended.We use a cool, mist humidifier in the summer time (temps above 100F) and this steam humidifier in the winter. This is much easier to keep clean, does not require filters to eliminate the spread of calcium carbonate, and it just better all around. If it weren`t for the fact that we don`t want to add heat to the house in the summer (that the HVAC then has to remove) we would use this year round.I would, however, recommend that you NOT follow the cleaning instructions provided with the unit if you have hard water. Our water is quite hard and we clean it once a week: REMOVE the probe housing (two screws, not difficult, but they are T10 Torx -- very commonly available these days); knock off the built up mineralization; soak the probes in vinegar IF NEEDED; swirl a little chlorine (and water) in the water tub; and put it all back together taking care with the screws because they go into plastic. Takes about 5 minutes, on average.The &amp;quot;black stuff&amp;quot; and acrid smell some have reported is because they let the mineralization build up until it was shorting the two probes and &amp;quot;burning&amp;quot;. This can happen with very hard water (like ours) if you don`t remove the probe housing because despite following the cleaning instructions, the bits are too big to shake out effectively and build up in the housing. There is nothing about this unit that will cause a smell or other yuck if it is maintained properly.",1,2022

1189445,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"It works however, does not put out much steam and has to be cleaned of scale about every 2 uses.

1189471,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"While it does work, kindof. It just doesn`t put off nearly enough mist to make a difference. I had it in a 300 sqft bedroom. On its highest setting, it could only bring the humidity from 25% to 30%. Will be returning, not worth the money if it can`t bring the humidity to my desired level of 45-50%",1,2022
1189472,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"The height of the heater in the water well is too high, exposing the top 1/4&amp;quot; of the heat with no water covering it. It gives off an acrid burning smell and is not usable due to these fumes. There is no way to adjust any part to correct this problem.",1,2022

1189529,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,This stuff works really well. The scent is there but not obnoxious. I put warm water in the humidifier and put some directly in and run over night for my baby and it work so well.,1,2022

Its been easy to clean, which I partially credit to only using distilled water due to local water being extremely hard. I run it near constantly and have yet to run into any issues, it just pumps out cool mist all day. I tossed the Vicks scent pad that came with it because I didnt need it; I primarily use it to add moisture to the air in an otherwise very dry home in winter.

1189820,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,The humidifier makes three distinct noises that make this nothing but an irritant: 1) It gurgles constantly as the ultrasonic transducer throws water up the tube the mist emerges from; the water then drips back into the reservoir making the gurgling drip sound. 2) It emits a high frequency whine while in operation. 3) It emits a noise like the sound of a small fan that I assume is the ultrasonic transducer operating. Overall for me it is unusable as I cannot sleep with these various sounds. It does however humidify and it is easy to fill with water. If you don`t care about quite operation it make work for you.,1,2022

Cleaning of the unit is not rocket science. Here is the issue with warranty. You can register this product at Vicks official site. But if you end up having an issue with the device, the downfall of waranty is that you have to ship defective unit to location at your own expense and unfortunately you cant go there in person to drop it off. It cost me almost 75% of unit cost to ship defective unit to their location which is less than 20km away from where I live.

1190338,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"This is likely the worst humidifier we`ve ever owned and we`ve owned many for my daughter with allergies. I have never had an ultrasonic humidifier which sounds like it has a `fan`. The `ultrasonic` feature of this humidifier must be extremely low quality, as on every setting, you hear what sounds like a loud `fan` noise. If that`s not enough, it constantly sounds like a faucet running in a sink full of water, not a drip or trickle, a constant, `water running` sound, which is not relaxing or pleasant - it`s a humidifier, if I want `Zen`, I`ll purchase a product to make water noises. I read the negative reviews, and they all say it`s loud and can`t be cleaned easily and that the `upside down` fill is a mess. THIS IS ALL TRUE. Trust your instincts as you consider purchasing this. I knew better, but thought with so many reviews, why not give it a try. Vick`s outsources this to the lowest bidder and gets the lowest quality product in return. Maybe a customer service rep will reply and say `they`d like to talk more about this` or that `they stand behind their product and they are sorry I was unhappy`. At the end of the day.... Vick`s makes menthol jelly rub, not humidifiers. This thing is garbage. I tried it for 2 weeks, with distilled water and nothing changed. It`s VERY loud and makes a mess. There are plenty of newer designed, Top Fill options in the market and that`s what I replaced this with once I returned it. WASTE OF MONEY, WASTE OF TIME",1,2022

In the last two days, the temperature has been 18 and 7 degrees outside. It is very dry in the winter and my humidity gauge would show 21% humidity or less for the past two winters. By using both of these humidifiers at the same time my humidity level inside (24hrs later) is up to 31% and feels better inside.I turned one of them off in the past two hrs to see how well one would work and the humidity level dropped down to 25%.

1190386,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"Its a small and cute humidifier. It comes with one pack of vapopad which needs to be inserted in bottom slot. Honestly, the menthol smell was too strong for me. I will cut the vapopad in half for next use. I purchased the pack of 12 vapopads with menthol scent as it works well if you have cold. If you put on highest setting you can see the vapour coming out of the humidifier. So, I use the lowest setting. I will leave it only for 3 hours on before sleep because this humidifier is very efficient. You can see the vapor coming out. I would love to try the lavender scent vapopad but on amazon the price is $50 which is very expensive. Overall, its a good humidifier and will help with cold or sinus as you can insert the vicks vapopad and the whole room smells like vicks.",1,2022

It`s easy, easy, easy compared to so many humidifiers (we`ve had many). It`s small &amp;convenient, vs. awkward &amp; dripping all over the place when you try to refill or clean it. Also it cleans up easier than any I`ve ever had. It`s mostly quiet, but once in awhile makes a brief, very soft, low-key `water sound.` Nothing to disqualify it in my book!

1190423,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,There is no way that these are actual Vicks VapoPad Refills. They stink! Either they are knock offs or theyre expired. Very disappointed.,1,2022
1190434,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,I have a Levoit cool mist humidifier. This is the second winter I am using it and it never smelled.

1190468,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"Its a good product. It included a single sample vicks pad ... which if there were 2 it probably wouldve worked better. The steam is a good flow and you can switch it to 2 different flows. Very effective when I was suffering from a sinus infection. The only bad thing is that the inhaler part which is made of plastic smells bad. And Im not sure if its BPA free product. Id advise to clean before use and after use . And you shouldnt place it on your face cause its uncomfortable, but place it close to your face",1,2022

1190495,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Super simple to use (just add a pinch of salt).Sanitary because it boils off the water and kills bacteria and fungi, unlike cold mist humidifiers. I can`t overstate how important this is. Cold mist and evaporative humidifiers have to stay clean to be safe, and most designs will retain bacteria and mold in inaccessible crevices and pockets.Cold mist humidifiers will cool the room because the water droplets have to steal heat from the air to actually vaporize. This will heat the room instead, making it a better choice for winter.Finally, it`s very affordable.",1,2022

1190564,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,Gives out good amount of steam. I do wish it had an on/off button. I bought the Vicks pads to use along with it but they are not worth the price.,1,2022
1190578,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Sooo happy with this purchase! Living in Colorado the air is very dry during the winter months and having this humidifier around makes such a difference. The mist output is perfect for medium sized rooms.,1,2022

1190624,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,Works well. I end up spilling a little when I go to clean it if there is any water left inside. Would recommend. Helped the kids when they had a cold.,1,2022

However, when I read what I had to do every week to clean it, I wish I had read the instructions before I bought it. I cleaned it every 5-6 days but once it got so corroded with gunk, I couldn`t get it off no matter how often I tried to clean it with cleaning vinegar. I did what it said to do but after 5-6 weeks, it doesn`t work very well anymore. I`m going to try a different make.",1,2022

Inside the product was alright after I verified the electrical connections after fully drying the inner plastic package. Can Amazon drivers ring the doorbell when leaving a package outside in freezing wind and snow? It would be of great help !!,1,2022
1190766,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Its too noisy and the settings dont go high enough. So the vapor doesnt expel throughout the whole room,1,2022
1190797,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Purchased this for my newborns room. Works well and humidification stays overnight. Please ensure to clean the tank at least every 2-3 days to prevent fungus/mold growth,1,2022

1190833,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,I genuinely feel that this machine has made me more sick. The cool mist feels like dry air is being blown out. Our humidity levels never got better during the two weeks we had this little thing. Do yourself a favor and skip this purchase.,1,2022
1190837,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I couldn`t speak due to a bad sore throat and my nose is badly clogged. My instincts told me to buy this and try it out. It comes with 1 vapopad but all I need is a small jar of vicks vaporub. I put a small amount of vicks vaporub on my nostrils and started inhaling steam from this machine. You can feel the vicks coming down to your throat if you take a deep and slow inhale. It was heavenly! I can speak after inhaling my first round. It somehow unclogged my nose after another. Use it regularly and you will feel better in no time.,1,2022

I Like That You Can Add The Vicks VapoPads. 2 VapoPads Makes It Smell Stronger Which Is Great For My Congestion This Year. A Full Water Tank Seems To Last A Good Few Days With The Mist Mode Being On Full Blast. The Only Thing I Really Dislike About The Machine Is That you Take The Water Container Off, Fill The Water Container Upside Down, Have To Dry That Portion Before You Put It Back Onto The Machine Mounting Area Or Else Water Will Drop Elsewhere In Your Home.

Weve only had it for a few weeks and 2 of my kids have already needed it! Its easy to put together and set up. Takes a few minutes to heat up and create steam. Works well for relieving a stuffy nose!

In a nutshell- this humidifier gave off the worst fumes I have ever smelled. I have owned many different steam humidifiers in the past. I prefer them over the ultrasonic ones (I have many of those too) because it doesnt blast whatever is in the water into the air. Its normal for steam humidifiers to have a bit of fume during the first run but the fumes from the VIcks humidifier is so noxious that my kid woke up 2x the first night coughing and asking for water because his throat hurts from the smell. My whole second floor smells like the fumes from the humidifier. I moved it to the back of the den, near my back door, with the door open to air out the fumes but the humidifier is still creating strong fumes.

On my very first time and every use after (which I have stopped using the item because of the leaking, the product leaked out and onto my hardwood floors.I have used nothing but Vicks products for over 13 years and it seems that their quality is lacking.I personally feel that the product does not measure up to the value or hype.I would not recommend this humidifier because of the leaking issues.",1,2022

Immediately had issues with it not steaming (even with salt added),loud noises,and it not working even with the reservoir still half full of water. I figured it was just old and it was free anyway,so I stopped using that one and ordered a new one from Amazon. The new one is even worse. Horrible noises, shoots boiling hot water everywhere (I burned my leg getting hit), steams minimally,turns off long before the water is gone, and the cord gets hot very quickly. There is also a burnt look to where the water disperses and around the lip of the reservoir. This is very dangerous so after less then an hour`s use,it`s broken and unsafe. The one positive is that I asked for a refund and was given one and told I didn`t have to mail the broken one back so that was easy and painless.

They do the job.We reordered this humidifier at the end of 2021 to replace an identical older unit, because it had begun to run very noisily. These tend to last 2-4 years before they conk out, so what occurred was the norm.This new one, though, was defective. We used it daily for exactly 6 weeks, when it suddenly stopped working - ran noisily then stopped heating, stopped producing steam, smelled weird, and burned out. Of greater concern is that it fried the GIF outlet it was plugged into, prompting a call to an electrician for repair and restoration of the electric outlet and adjacent line/outlet over the weekend.I am going to reorder as I am assuming this was a one-time problem that won`t recur. We shall see. (Carton already discarded; figure there`s no chance of getting a refund...) I`ll update this review if we have another issue.",2,2022

I cant stand it!So I made this purchase hoping it would make a difference for me and my dogs as well because this ridiculous dry weather, dries out their skin too.A difference it definitely made!! I don`t wake up with every drop of moisture from my body sucked out like a vampire by this insufferable dry weather!! My dogs coats are healthy and they barely scratch anymore!I love getting a full night`s sleep without having to wake up to hydrate myself every few hours.I live in a bachelor`s apartment and I knew I didn`t need a very big one but I was worried about it being too small but its perfect!My dogs and I thank you ",2,2022

Just keep it clean and youll be good to go!The seller of this unit went absolve and beyond for me to get this to my Mom.

I took a look at the first page of instructions and there were a ton of warnings like I have to plug it into a wall, it must sit on a hard heat resistant surface the entire time while using(you cant hold it!), never let it even so much as tilt while using, etc. Basically it seems like way more trouble than its worth and its actually dangerous to use. The worst part, its not returnable! Wtf? Its unused, fulfilled by Amazon, but I cant return it? Where does it say this!? And when you try to return it Amazon presents a link to its return policies, not policy. So there are 50 different sets of rules and I have to guess which category this fits into to even get an explanation. I am very unhappy to say the least.",2,2022
1200328,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"The filters stay wet when not in use, and are meant to permeate air, so they will naturally get moldy. Using the unit every night on low, I saw mold after about 2 weeks. They don`t sell the exact PWF2 filter any more, so the closest filter is WF2. This filter is tight and needs to be mashed to fit. The filter is ~$10/ea., so in about two months you`ll spend more on the filters than on the humidifier. I cleaned the unit out with bleach between each filter change, but it didn`t help prevent mold. The humidifier is very loud on high, which is saying a lot, because I like white noise during sleeping. But on high you can`t even talk to someone in the room.",2,2022

It will be working fine, you fall asleep, wake up with a dry, cracked, bleeding nose, to find it stopped working with the tank of water still full..... My Vicks Warm Mist Humidifier is working above and beyond my expectations. It is easy to fill, easy to clean and easy to sanitize. I turn it on high and I have about a quarter of a tank of water left after 9 hours. It has yet to fail me one time. If the humidity is up outside, I can run it on low at night and get two nights out of one tank of water. I do have a hygrometer in my bedroom and the humidity is staying exactly where it is supposed to be during the night.

A gallon of distilled each day would be way too expensive but so is my Pur filter in pitcher. But any unit would have that water cost. It runs 24/7, so far so good. I am happy with it.

I bought this to steam my avocado tree during the colder seasons and it isn`t working. It will steam for an hour and stay on with water full in the tank still.

1200432,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,So easy to fill up and use. Works well and actually adds moisture to the air. Used in our babys room and doubles as a white noise machine as it has a very slight humming/bubbling sound. Happy with the purchase!,2,2022
1200434,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"All around this is a great warm humidifier. Works well and efficient with water consumption vs steam dispersion. The Only downside isn`t anything the seller could help. One of the small plastic fasteners that keeps the cooling tower attached to the base was broken before I got it, but it doesn`t affect how the machine runs at all just a simple annoyance that there is anything broken but it`s likely from being shaken or dropped during shipping. I don`t think the damage is bad enough to warrant a refund or return in my opinion. It works great. Thanks :)",2,2022
1200437,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"I bought this to add Moisture to my room because it has been dry and causing dry coughing. The steam is very little, can barely see it so it doesn`t provide enough moisture to my room. Its like walking into the room without the humidifier.",2,2022
1200438,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"I ran the humidifier for about an hour and a half most evenings and cleaned/disinfected weekly.

1200440,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Easy to fill. Distributes a lot of water vapor into our 150 sq ft bedroom. We refill it every other day and run it all night and sometimes most of the morning, too. The opening for adding water is also large enough to place one of those charcoal fish in it to prevent mold.",2,2022
1200442,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Have had this 2 winters now. Others only lasted one winter. I use it every day bc very dry in my house. It`s lightweight and tank lasts 24 hrs. Not good if you have arthritic hands bc it does require turning the seal opener to fill &amp; refill w water. It has a red light to tell you when it`s empty. Bought second one for another room.,2,2022
1200455,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,The steam is WONDERFUL but it makes too much noise for it to run all night.,2,2022

1200457,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Great! Exactly what I expected. No complaints. Too bad Canada does not carry as much Vicks Vapor specific things.,2,2022

1200476,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,"The delivery was fast, which I needed as my son was very congested and using this in our vaporizer helps him sleep all night. My problem was this box only came with 5 packs instead of 6 and each pad was dry. I`ve used these pads before and they`re supposed to be moist and these were not. You still smell the vicks so it did help a bit but it seems we received an old bad box. Will stick to buying from Walmart",2,2022

Individual package is easy to open which is a huge bonus. I feel like they loose effectiveness in about 6 hours of use, but thats better than none with cold or allergy symptoms. This is so much less messy than ointment.",2,2022
1200505,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,I have been waiting for this to come back in stock after a few months of not being able to find one in stores or online. Once it was I orded one and it did not dissapoint. The only downside was I had to put a towel under it.... Because it leaked all over the table. Maybe this is because I filled it up with too much water but I only filled it to the max water line.,2,2022
1200506,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,I never had any problems before but there is no moisture in the pads.,2,2022

1200512,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,It hasnt budged at 15% relative humidity since I got it a month ago. My humidifier I purchased says its 34%. Waste of money. Upset I cant return,2,2022
1200514,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,The tank had a hair line crack or something and it just broke when filled with water and when seating it into the base. I got two uses out of it before it broke. No forcing or slamming of the tank occurred. Only normal usage.,2,2022

1200526,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,My unit didnt come with an instruction manual or the sample Vicks pack. Pretty disappointed,2,2022
1200537,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,This really works great! It puts warm moisture back in the air. Easy to operate. Just refill water yak and turn it on. Runs for hours. I love mine and it brings some relief with sinus issues,2,2022

1200549,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Love that this item keeps my humidifier working clear and clean. Just wish it was cheaper. I kept it functional for two months instead of the recommended one month for this reason and it appears to still be getting the job done.,2,2022

1200576,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"I ordered this once and it came in and didnt work. Would not make any steam. Would not heat up. Added a bit of salt and nothing. So I asked for a replacement. I got the new one and same thing. It just wont make the steam. When I first plugged in the second one, it seemed like it was doing something but it didnt last long at all. Maybe a day. I always thought vicks was a reliable brand when it came to vaporizers but I was very disappointed. Ill be returning this one and will probably go with a different brand.",2,2022

1200578,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Does not work,2,2022
1200603,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"I have a humidifier and the liquid inhalant but this is so much better. The pads are a little costly but totally worth it. Using the liquid inhalant in the humidifier doesn`t seem to work as well and it eventually loses its potency. It spills over the side of the reservoir and is very difficult to clean off. It can damage polished wooden furniture and leave a permanent ugly place. This eliminates all that nonsense. You place the pad in the slot and close the lid then you plug it in and it doesn`t take very long for the vapors to spread all over the room. I prefer the lavender but there`s something nostalgic about the classic mentholated version. It wasn`t as much as I thought it would be to purchase this and I`m glad I did it. We don`t have an electrical outlet that close to the bed so I`m glad it comes with a fairly long cord so we don`t have to use an extension for it. I`d prefer it turned itself off automatically or had a power switch but that`s no big deal because it`s just as easy to unplug as anything else. Highly recommended for people who suffer allergies, like myself, and would be great for a child because it has a night light that isn`t annoyingly bright. Doesn`t bother cats or dogs so that`s a bonus if you`re also a pet lover.",2,2022
1200604,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,A good steamer but the drawback was it didn't have an automatic lock off when the water tank was empty.,2,2022
1200614,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Simple to operate. Quiet. Great product!,2,2022
1200615,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"If you love lavender and also love Vicks then this is a great idea! Smells nice but also a little different but it`s fantastic if you`re suffering sinus allergy issues and have a hard time sleeping because you can only breathe out of one nostril or can`t breathe at all. My girlfriend snores because of allergies and sinus issues and this greatly diminishes and sometimes eliminates it altogether. Perfect in the mini vaporizer, in a Vicks humidifier, and/or in conjunction with a standard or cool mist vaporizer. I wish it came with more in a box but 12 is still a good amount of pads if you only need them occasionally. Lasts around 8 hours or more so they`re very efficient. Highly recommend for allergy sufferers and also works great if you want to incorporate them into yoga, breathing exercises, or meditation. Perfect for sleepless nights and pet owners. Would be great for children`s rooms as well.",2,2022
1200618,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,this is the second Vicks Humidifier I got. The first one is still working. this second one I am giving to my Granddaughter. I think this is the best humidifier on the market. no filter and easy to clean.,2,2022
1200620,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,This work great! I put them in my daughter`s humidifier at night and they make a big difference l like that they have the Vicks medicine AND lavender essential oils. The smell is strong enough to help the congestion but not so much that it`s overbearing.,2,2022
1200624,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,This is a great humidifier. I like that it holds a lot of water so I don`t have to worry about refilling until the next night before bed. It has an adjustable knob so you can get the kind of output you want. I also like that it has the compartment for the medicine pads.,2,2022

No glug, glug, glugging all night.This humidifier is easy to fill, has a nice large basin so Im not constantly refilling it, has an adjustable dial so I can control the steam flow, and best of all its pretty quiet. No loud glug every half hour. Im taking the time to write this for anyone else seeking something on the quiet side. Hope this helps! Ill likely purchase another one for other rooms.

1200724,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I have a small bedroom. Gets hot and dry in there. It affects my breathing . The cool mist vaporizer is making my breathing and sleeping better.

However we have only had it eight weeks in the fan is now so loud it is crazy. I dont know if the fan is broken, or if over time it just starts to make a ton of noise. But this is too expensive from a to well-known company to make such a noise, sounding broken so early. Disappointing.",2,2022

Then, yesterday, after less than six months, if just stopped working. The orange light comes on, but nothing else happens.

1200769,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,If you have the time to refill it ever four hours its okay. Barley any vapor comes out of it and barley helped for a 8x10 room. It gives no relief and once it uses up even the slightest bit of water the mist stops completely so it doesnt even get you through a full night. It also takes forever to warm up.

I have returned it right away because of following reasons. 1. Water capacity is too low. It just takes 3-4 tablespoon of water. 2. It takes ~6 mins to heatup water and for the device to start the steam. 3. Main reason for returning it back:The vapor that comes out of it is almost nothing even at high setting and not enough to recover from any kind of sinus. Even if you really go close to the attached mask, you won`t feel much.",2,2022

As soon as I turn it on, I had an allergic reaction. Itchy eyes and constant sneezing regardless of low or high setting. Definitely impossible to be allergic to distilled water. I did not add anything to the water. I did not add Vick`s pad to the machine. Just a simple distilled water and ran the machine. Upon inspection nothing was dirty. My suspicion is that it`s a refurbished product that did not get cleaned well by the manufacturer. Something was added by the previous owner that I am allergic to. Or perhaps some sort of chemical treatment inside the water reservoir that I am allergic to.In conclusion, I want to love this machine but I had to return it.

No more electric shocks when touching door nobs or hair flying around when brushed, and they cut down on dry sore throats and stuffy noses.The calcium and other chemicals in our city tap water do get cooked and solidified and stick to the heating units. As the chemical crusts break off the rods the &amp;quot;crumbs&amp;quot; sink to the bottom of the unit and then later get dumped when I rinse out the bowls.The crumbs are harmless and do not toxify the water, steam, or the air. We all drink those minerals in the water and haven`t died yet. I have taken the units apart to knock the scale off from the heating units. It`s easy to do and prolongs the life of the units.After reading the reviews, I think there is too much hysteria over the mineral deposits. I do agree with protecting the surfaces that these units rest on. Do not put directly on wood and remember that water, heat, and steam are involved.I prefer these units because other humidifiers are so hard to clean and they collect molds so very easily.

1200920,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I like how much water it holds,2,2022
1200922,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,This works good but too refill makes a mess. when you lift the container that you fill up to refill water gets everywhere. it should be refillable from top.,2,2022

1200970,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"It does make great humidity, just what I wanted. I have it on a smart plug. It runs 4 hrs and off for 2 hrs. And even though it is on for only 16 of 24 hrs, it still uses all the water in less than one day(24hrs). In order for this to run for 24 straight hrs, you would have to double the tank size or buy two units. And run each for half the day. As I need the humidity to be consistent all the time, I will have to modify it with a small float valve and water line, again not convenient.",2,2022
1200971,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Buy it for my bedroom to use overnight. Harder to speel in low humidity, dry mouth, dry lips. I turn it on when I go to bed and turn it off when I get up. I sleep a lot bettre now",2,2022

1200983,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"I bought this specifically so I could use the liquid Vicks. However the area for the liquid is less than a teaspoon. It doesnt last long or get strong enough to any good. Its also very inconvenient to put the Vicks where its supposed to go. It inevitably spills into the water area, which is not good",2,2022
1200984,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"The noise level definitely not compatible to other top seller. I got this because of the easy to clean and not filter needed to clean description. However I have been using it for a month. I dont clean it every day but I clean it at least every few days or two days after using and dry it up. But the mineral built up is serious in every corner and part of the humidifier. Though there is not filter needed to be cleaned, I pretty much need to disassemble the entire thing into pieces to scrap the mineral out..not recommending.",2,2022

Used it for about a week, the slime that was on the tank was nasty after only a week, shocking. Got this little fish, and the tank slime has been reduced so much. Its been 2-3 weeks and I do not have the slime build up like I did each week before this little guy arrived. I was hoping that it did not have a strong scent, I am super sensitive, it has no smell at all; it`s like activated charcoal but grey. I would like it if they had a container that you could refill. Buy one container and bulk &amp;quot;charcoal&amp;quot;, seems like that would be less waste. Thats what I did when I had fish.",2,2022

I put it alongside my recliner, placed a towel over my head (and the machine) and drew in that soothing cool moist air. I didn`t use any chemicals. It took me a few days before I bought it. Now if I get a cough, that will be the first thing I do!!",2,2022
1201036,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"After attempting to use other quick and cheap methods to alleviate the dryness due to winter conditions in my home, I decided to make a solid investment in a mid-range priced unit to assist in this need. I am glad I chose this humidifier for both the brand name and for the purpose of adding additional moisture to the air without causing irreputable harm to myself, and my home space. My grandparents and parents had a similar humidifier (from Sears) while I was growing up, but certainly with the changes and necessities of the new millennium, this humidifier from Vicks is like a familiar old friend. Yes, I am old, haha.PROS: (IMO)- Super simple operation for light misting to medium misting- Perfect for small to medium sized spaces- Perfect for nighttime bedside use- Extremely quiet and unnoticeable output noise while in use- Warm steam output with no heavy condensation build up- Easy to clean, easy to fill (strongly recommended to keep regular cleaning with white distilled vinegar due to calcium and hard water deposit build up on the heating element)- Nice lighted dial and indicator when water reservoir needs to be refilled- Easy access add on inhalant port spoutCONS: IMO-Lightweight plastic, which is a little delicate, but with proper handing, care and maintenance of this humidifier will result in a great lifetime of use-Mineral and hardwater build up over extended use/time can be problematic but can be somewhat avoided by using a soft and non-abrasive scrubber (chore girl) or a magic eraser. Due diligence is the key. Since the plastic used in this unit is lightweight, it does easily scratch and crack if it takes a hard accidental hit. I would advise treating and using it with care as you would with a delicate item.WHAT TO WATCH FOR:Use cool water, NOT excessively cold, nor warm or hot water. This will cause severe damage to the heating element and can potentially void the limited warranty and extended warranty protection (if you have it). Give this unit time to warm the water to activate the warm steam.Good value, good price and long-term use with some TLC. Definitely recommended!",2,2022
1201043,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"Great product, helps with congestion and improved dry nose. Just dont use with hard water as it will shut off after 20 mins of use due to mineral build up over the heating element.",2,2022

1201155,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Nice warm mist vaporizer. Works well. I like that it has a slot to place the Vicks Vapopads . I use the lavender menthol ones.

1201401,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,This did not work well at all,2,2022
1201402,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Love that you can plug it in and youre good to go (less work than a diffuser!) and kid-room friendly. They are a tad expensive but you cant beat the convenience.,2,2022
1201406,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I use these in my Kaz/Vicks V3100 humidifier. They fit fine and have a fairly good lifespan. I usually replace them after about a month and a half or so. I run my humidifier nightly during the winter months so I use three to four of these a season. You know when to replace them because there is a noticeable decrease in wicking of the water. The minerals in my hard water tend to deposit on the filter over time but that is to be expected. I have had no problems with mold growing on the filters and I do use a fish to help prevent that.,2,2022
1201424,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Works great and even greater savings!,2,2022
1201429,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"Only thing is that it does make some noise, bearable its like white noise. And I couldnt use the night light by itself like the Frida Humidifier. I changed humidifiers because the frida was too hard to clean and dry for storage. This one is perfect because off how big the opening is. Overall great purchase just tiny flaws that I can live with.",2,2022
1201430,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,It`s everything I was expecting from this machine. Works very well and it`s nice looking and solid.,2,2022

1201525,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I like it,2,2022
1201527,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,The scent is terrible 1/10 would recommend. The return window is not the typical Amazon standard so I cannot even return them for a better/ different scent. Dont purchase!,2,2022

1201543,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Very, very little noise especially after it has been operating just a few minutes. Sure works better than the antihistamines and decongestants without all the side effects. Sleep was better as I didn`t wake up several times due to congestion. So glad to find this. While it is small that just gives it lighter weight to refill and carry.",2,2022
1201553,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"I was hoping the plastic smell would go away after a few days, but it has not. My wife says this product is not usable. Amazon says it is not returnable even though I received it only 4 days ago.",2,2022
1201554,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,Used it for putting moisture in room.,2,2022
1201567,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,I only use it as a humidifier. Larger tank means less filling. There is no point to using the vicks inserts. They smell weird and they dont last long anyway. I wish the output of moisture was greater but its still a good machine.,2,2022
1201568,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"Overall, I like it. My biggest gripe is that it doesn`t shut down when empty, but it is a manual and not digital so pros and cons. Pros is that analog appliances would typically last as long as the mechanical parts would allow. The directional spout is convenient as well as the large opening to fit in smaller hands to clean out the tank. But there is a center obstruction (tunnel way) that make getting to the back difficult, so you`d have to use a flexible baby bottle brush (easiest I found). It is a tad awkward trying to gently settle in the full tank as the grab handle is only in the top back and the rest is just smooth slippery wall. I clipped my finger tip a few times already. As with some of the other reviewers, when the tank is empty, it`ll just keep on...no steam because it`s analog so you`ll have to be vigilant about that water level.Honestly, I never tried the aroma pad warmer. I am mainly happy that I no longer have a mildewy wick/filter to constantly change out. I`d buy this again.",2,2022
1201569,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"This item is useless. I filled it with water to breathe in the steam B and the design is so bad the steam didnt even come through the hole in the top.Its basically a big plastic mug, except the top is so badly designed no steam rises: you would be better off holding a large mug of hot tea near your face and breathing that.I threw it out the same day. Save your money. Its junk.",2,2022
1201570,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,EASY TO USE,2,2022
1201572,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,"It has very small chamber for water. It generates steam daily quickly, will say within a minute but runs out of water fairly quickly.Also, it do not cover my kids face forget about adults face. Wife bought this because she wanted to use steam for facial exposure.At $40 its not worth it.",2,2022
1201573,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Barely steams most of the time. I have an older one that works much better but gave it to my daughter to use and I just got a new one. Followed the directions which are strange because they are not the same as the old version - did I mention it works better? New one says it it doesnt steam it is the water and I have to add salt. Same water works fine in older version. So I add salt. Sometimes it steals and sometimes it doesnt. New version must be China crap. Old one you can smell the vapor. New one cant smell anything. Stop making your products in China. They suck. I am on the hunt for one that actually works,2,2022
1201583,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,Works fine not impressed but I do love the smell of Vicks. I would rather just use the Vicks out of the jar. No integrity and no returns on the machine itself. It came broken and they would not refund or return it or replace it for that matter the company is lacking in integrity.,2,2022
1201593,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Great Vapor No Problem With The Unit.Dont Know About Some Other Reviews Works Great Good Stream I Am Assuming Bad Reviews Are Operator Error.,2,2022
1201594,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,This humidifier barely let out any steam at all and it is so cheaply designed and ugly as crap.,2,2022
1201595,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,It cleaned my nose area so well! The more I use it the better the results...,2,2022
1201599,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Helped me trough the nights my throat felt so dry along the Vicks humidifier.,2,2022
1201609,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"As others have said...very loud constant dripping noise. It`s not a quiet or soothing drip. There is no way I can sleep with the dripping. I can hear it above the white noise machine. Disappointed, returning.",2,2022
1201610,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,I can honestly say I feel very disappointed especially because the Vicks brand is usually very good. I bought three of these at a time and purchased the Vicks scented inserts also. I ran all three units with and without the Vicks sticks and even without them every time I used these it would leave a film all over the furniture and everything in its path. Ive never had this problem with other humidifiers before,2,2022
1201623,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Dead on arrival ??!! Took out of box. Used 2 nights and STOPPED COMPLETELY BEFORE THE 2nd night was over. WORTHLESS!!!,2,2022
1201624,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,Did not negatively affect sleep. Excellent adjustable vapour output. Menthol packs worked but were expensive.,2,2022
1201625,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"After using it for few years, I realized that other options were better available. I spend too much time in cleaning, and after each winter it stop for some time and doesnt start easily again. Noise level is comparably high",2,2022
1201626,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"It disassembles very easily making it easier to store, very simple to use a couple spoonfuls of tap water into the reservoir screw the top back on Wait 6 minutes and you`ve got some nice steam going theres a small adjustment tab on the side so you can control the amount of steam... I like it because it helps clear up my sinus congestion and if I check my oximeter after I have taken a treatment with this it reads one point higher than prior to using the device.. So I know for me I`m getting a little more oxygen into my lungs than I was prior to using it.",2,2022
1201638,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,This is our third purchase of this terrific product for our humidifier. Simple and easy to use and very effective at keeping microbial growth virtually nil.,2,2022
1201639,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Soothing warm mist. Really helped! Did buy another vicks vaporizer with top filling which is easier to fill. But this item was shipped quickly and really was wondeful to have!,2,2022
1201657,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I like that it is so simple and easy to use. Works for me.,2,2022
1201658,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I really like this vaporizer works well,2,2022
1201659,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"We have very dry winters here in northern interior, we bought this for its price and its been working real well",2,2022
1201660,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,Works as expected. Humidifies the surrounding good. Putting table salt helped to kick off water vapours.,2,2022
1201661,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"Yes it takes a few minutes for the machine to warm to make steam, no it`s not like you`re standing in the middle of a very hot shower, but is it enough steam and Vapor to inhale to give you relief and breathe?? ABSOLUTELY! we don`t need a &amp;quot;hot shower performance&amp;quot; of steam to open our sinuses. If that`s what you expect then take a hot shower. Would I recommend this? Yes. Is this little thing worth it, yes. Did it help me fight Covid, yes again!! worked great in my opinion ;-)",2,2022
1201702,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Soooo disappointed :(. I should have spent a little more to get a better quality humidifier. We have hard water which I think adds to the problem but it lets off little to no steam. Definitely not worth the buy.,2,2022
1201709,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,This is the best! The warm mist cleared up my Covid congestion. The soft noise is nice too.,2,2022

1201718,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,Hard to hold the top of humidifier as it is filling with water while holding the jug of pouring water. Cannot set top of humidifier down to fill. Motor has become progressively noisier. Winter #2 and looking at different humidifiers.,2,2022

1201752,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,My humidifier was delivered December 30th and the fan on it has already quite and it was not even ran everyday. I guess I should have listened to the other reviews when they said theirs didn`t last long either.,2,2022

1201809,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"These are great and I love to use them with my steamer. But the price is just too much. I feel like I have to use these very sparingly. And never put two of them in your steamer - as the instructions tell you to do. It`s far too overwhelming and you waste them. When I have sinus issues, I usually steam twice a day. One pad will last through both 15 minute steam sessions just fine.",2,2022
1201816,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"I get dry throat in the winter, it drives me nuts... this little unit has been used quite a bit this winter and I`m happy to say that my throat is moist and no longer irritated.Nice and quiet too. Definitely worth it.",2,2022

1201841,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,Seems like it will work well but it won`t fit into the openi.ng of the recommended humidifier. Double check the opening of any humidifier it is recommended for,2,2022

So annoying and so disappointed on target!!",2,2022

1201892,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I purchased a warm steam vaporizer from Vicks. It`s fantastic. The Vapo pads are menthol and last up to 8hours of relief. I prefer to use this instead of medication. We were all very congested from Covid and we used the vaporizer for a few nights and it was a big relief.,2,2022
1201904,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,False advertising. The fish does not fit into the humidifier shown on the package.,2,2022
1201909,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,My folks picked up one of these and I was very surprised by the output of cool mist. I had to get one and I was not disappointed. It does a great job of keeping the house humid in winter.,2,2022
1201910,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"Waited to use this until the need came. Got it all ready and was excited to plug in. After one minute the plug sparked and the machine stopped working.

1201915,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"This is so much better than the recent &amp;quot;improvements&amp;quot; to vaporization devices. It is old school,just water and electrical heating units. It is designed to wear out, so only expect one seasonof use, but it is cheap so who cares? The newer design, expensive &amp;quot;cool&amp;quot; vapor units get pluggedwith lint and grime anyway, so you are buying filters and cleaning them endlessly. They recommendusing distilled water, but that gets expensive real fast.

1201947,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"I bought this while my wife and I were suffering from congestion from a head cold. We got tired of smearing Vicks under our noses every night before bed and I remembered when I was a child that my parents would put Vicks in a &amp;quot;vaporizer&amp;quot; that would fill the room with that smell of eucalyptus and gun grease and greatly relieved breathing difficulties caused by a stuffy nose. A little on-line research revealed this little plug-in device that, ostensibly, would provide the same relief but without the mess and hassle. Well, we were both sorely disappointed. We even bought an extra pack of the little strips that go in this thing. The directions say &amp;quot;DO NOT TOUCH&amp;quot; the exposed strips (after removing them from the wrapper) with your fingers. I don`t know what happens if you do (Do your fingers fall off?) but that in itself makes this difficult to load and refill, which has to be done every night, by the way. After the first night`s use, we did not notice any difference. There was no smell of Vicks in the room-- the only way to smell anything was if you put your nose very close to the unit where it was plugged into the wall outlet. The second (and several consecutive) nights I doubled-up on the strips (which the directions say you can do) but neither of us noticed any difference. It was, in my opinion, a complete waste of money, except that I used Amazon points to buy it.

1201979,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,does not give off steam tried to call the manufacture and now calls me,2,2022
1201989,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,Works great but its kinda noisy. Sounds like you have a gurgling water fountain in your room. Easier to fill and clean than other units Ive had though.,2,2022
1201998,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,I can`t use at my humidifier. The fish is too big.,2,2022
1201999,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"These filters came loose in the shipping box, are made of cheap material that does not last, and are undersized and fit loosely in the humidifier. Would not recommend.",2,2022

1202037,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,We used them and they did nothing. I have used the Vicks vapo steam and it worked great. These are a waste of money and had no smell to them.,2,2022
1202042,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Long lasting vapor scent,my room smelled like vicks even the next day without turning on the vaporizer! Helps breathing ,good product.",2,2022

1202049,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"Kept it in the kitchen so far due to leakage concerns in the bedroom but it`s been on 24/7 all week and no issues yet, knock on wood. Definitely recommend. Very quiet and easy to use and fill.",2,2022
1202061,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Purchases January 2021 and used very lightly for 2 winter seasons.. The unit leaks all over once the water level gets down to 1/3 full. Would not recommend.,2,2022
1202067,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"I got these because I use a ton of humidifiers during winter for my plants and cleaning them is a pain. I honestly havent seen much, if any, difference in the humidifier with the tank cleaner vs the humidifier without. It appears that it might take slightly less time for it to get gross, but not much. A lot of my issue is hard water calcium deposits and it helps none with those.",2,2022
1202068,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I like that it makes me feel my humidifier has no bacterial residue so the vapor clean and fresh. Otherwise would be concerned humidifier is doing more harm than good. Live in Desert environment and moisturizing the air is super important for me. If I dont I wake up with Dry mouth sore throat. Really makes a difference.,2,2022
1202074,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"This is my 3rd purchase of this item (one at a store and two from Amazon), and based on previous experience, I convinced 2 co-workers to purchase same. LOVED previous units but this one is really noisy and is disrupting my sleep. CONSTANT kind of off and on bubbly water sound keeps waking me up. Thinking I need to return it and order another but not sure if I am allowed since I used it (which is how I discovered this unit is not of the same quality as the previous four). I guess this is a pretty mixed review... very please with 4 out of 5 purchases but when you can`t sleep due to the not normal noice from the 5th one... tends to make one kind of cranky and wishing to post a negative review.",2,2022
1202075,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Pretty cool how a machine can mistify air without using heat. Conveniently, you can change the direction that the mist ejects by swiveling the circular output nozzle on the top of the machine.",2,2022
1202076,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Dont buy it. Super low quality and didnt work.,2,2022
1202077,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Not at all what the name of the product leads you to believe. Its literally a way to hold hot water in your hand ~ the device does not produce steam.,2,2022
1202078,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,Basically just helps you breathe in Vicks. But theres no stream because whose tap water is that hot???,2,2022
1202079,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,For some reason it was not effective on me. The Indian way of using blanket n a vessel was better.,2,2022

1202102,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"I purchased the humidifier less than a month ago online &amp; have been using it almost every night. When I first started using it I was very impressed, but soon to be very disappointed. It is simple to set up, easy to clean, gave off a huge amount of &amp;quot;mist&amp;quot; but now gives off nothing. I have cleaned it, I have used distilled water to see if that makes a difference, I have tried everything and it no longer pushes out any &amp;quot;mist&amp;quot;. Don`t waste your money on this humidifier, stick with the ugly ones that some how last for forever. Very disappointed.",2,2022
1202104,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,The Vicks humidifier works well in room no larger than 20 ft by 20ft. Putting it beside you bed is not recommended because it can heat up the air around the bed and will be very uncomfortable as you sleep. Recommend watching the installation and usage video of Vicks humidifier on Youtube.,2,2022
1202106,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"It works well and sends out a significant amount of mist. It said it came with a scent pad and it didnt, but thats not a big deal. Cons: we put it on our wood side table and it completely warped the wood from condensation (our fault-we werent thinking. Dont put it on wood, though!) also it makes a dripping noise.",2,2022
1202113,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"Consider buying prior or the next model, this one has a flaw in the design and it WILL LEAK water. I liked the Vicks Warmer and bought 2 for my home. The old model and this one (version 2). I exchanged this one for the newer model (version 3). Comparing all 3, I can clearly see the engineering error. This one is the only one that does not have a double wall where you attach the tower. When the water condenses in the tower and start going back to the bottom of the tower it leaks through the area that the tower attaches to the base. I hope this save you the time of doing all the experiments that I had to do to get to this conclusion. I don`t like returning products and I only did because I was sure about the design flaw",2,2022

1202158,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Great way to help moisten the air and breathe better.,2,2022
1202161,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,The only time that I could actually smell the lavender was when I opened it from the package. I didn`t smell it at all while it was in the humidifier.,2,2022
1202165,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Perfect and easy way to ensure my humidifier runs well. So easy too. Just drop the fish in water reservoir and your done!,2,2022
1202168,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,I only ran this for an hour before I couldnt handle it anymore. Its so loud it sounds like a running toilet. Back it goes.,2,2022
1202169,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,I got this for my apartment as I get bad bloody noses during the dry months. The first one the base that holds the water in broke in about 3 weeks. I filed and got a replacement and the same happened with the new one after just 4 days. I cant think of what I wouldve done to break it.,2,2022
1202170,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Great humidifier- very good output,2,2022
1202174,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,I ask for return they never gave me. They have no option to return. So never buy it does not work and cheap quality.,2,2022

1202185,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Great so far! Ordered for my dad who needed one without filters. Worked right out of the box and hes been happy with it for the last month.,2,2022
1202190,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,Works well but is hard to refill without spilling water. Poor design of the water holder.,2,2022
1202196,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,These filters are terrific! They are thick and wick the water very well. The old filters were pathetically thin in comparison and I had to soak them in water first to get the wicking action started. These Protec filters have gained the status of my new standard. Thanks for producing a quality product in a sea of products that aren`t worth buying. I`m very pleased.,2,2022
1202197,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Does what I needed it to do. Have to fill it every night but well worth the effort.,2,2022
1202198,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,This is by far the best one Vicks has. The only bad thing is how short it lasts. It goes for 6 hours so if you use it like I do then before you wake up the scent is gone. And the vaporizer uses works best with 2 at a time so a box really give you enough for 3 uses. Other than that it is an amazing product.,2,2022

1202213,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I have tried other humidifiers and keep coming back to this one. I have bought it three or four times ( a plastic part tends to break). It`s easy to fill and easy to carry after filling; it lasts all night; it`s not too loud. Love it.,2,2022

1202243,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"This vaporizer is a giant safety hazard. We ordered 2 and both were defective. The first one made a burning noise and the outside was so hot it left burn marks around the ottoman it was sitting on. Additionally, there were black charred pieces on the inside.

1202254,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,The best thing about this humidifier is that its easy to clean. The two things that I dont like about it is the light on the knob (too bright in a dark room) and the noise that it makes. But in this case the good outweighs the bad for me.,2,2022

I also add a pinch of salt as they suggest. It will create some black residues but its just a part of how it functions, so I just clean the water out everyday.

However, Ive seen other packaging in the reviews where it says (and shows) works in ALL humidifiers.

1202554,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,First: Critical thinking...to those of you who experienced a `LEMON` stop complaining,2,2022
1202563,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,Its great for our baby to help with nasal and sinus issues!,2,2022
1202585,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,This is just a cup with a cover. . To put hot water. To get the steam wich will be close to nothing . Just do the pot and. A towel technique that our grandma did when we were kids,2,2022
1202587,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,I like how easy it is to fill the water tank compared to the one this replaced. The two steam settings is nice also.,2,2022
1202589,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,Thought these would last longer than 1 month. But????? I will use them as I need to,2,2022
1202590,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"I order this for my son, first i was not giving any steam but when i mix some salt in the water it started working like a chimney did add more normal water to control the steam, but its working good.",2,2022
1202599,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Works like a charm.,2,2022
1202616,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,The cord got so hot I had to unplug it.,2,2022
1202617,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"Works fine. Doesn`t spew pollutants into the air like the ultrasonic humidifier I bought a few weeks ago. I was disappointed in the very small fill opening. Only about a third the size of the opening in my old Vick`s vaporizer. The top of the tank isn`t level, so you have to hold it while it fills or it rocks out of position and water flow misses the opening.",2,2022
1202622,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Perfect for small rooms.,2,2022
1202624,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,It works in tank but not where tank connects to unit...which is understandable. I enjoy it.,2,2022
1202625,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Nothing to do besides open the packaging and drop it into your humidifier...seems to be working great.,2,2022
1202626,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Love this unit. Does not leave surrounding area wet. I started using this at nigt because I would cough all night due to dry air. This helped immediately. Low setting lasts about 2 nights.....running it at night only. Not very loud.,2,2022
1202631,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Perfect for small rooms.,2,2022
1202632,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"After using it for a month, it started emitting a burning smell when it got low on water and actually emitting smoke (not mist) like it was about to start a fire. Tried it again and did the same thing when water was low. I would not leave this alone to work, as could be a fire hazard.",2,2022
1202642,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,This Scent Works Good Its Not Strong Smell,2,2022
1202649,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Ordered online for my mother, was delivered within 1 day. Used in her bedroom to help her sleep at night (she is 97), during these dry winter months. She keeps the heat pretty high in her house so the humidifier has been wonderful in her bedroom. Easy to use, would suggest when you refill, do it over a sink or in the bathroom so avoid spills, as the container is large (holds 1 gallon). Use distilled water as directed. Great purchase, may get another one for another family member!",2,2022
1202655,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,It works great it says to use tap water but I use distilled. I do wish it produced more steam but it does work and gets the job done. I used it 2-3 times a day 10-15 min each as needed for sinus pressure. Also takes up to 6 min to start to produce steam. Over priced but works great.,2,2022
1202659,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"We have 4 of these. About 6 months in we usually notice an increase in sounds. The plastic ring on the cap that keeps the water scaled tight gets rough and a bit difficult to open as opposed to the smooth opening in the beginning when first purchased. After a year, 1 of them fully stopped working. After about 5 months 1 was very loud and Anson replaced it promptly.",2,2022
1202660,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Love this unit; only wish it was easier to clean!,2,2022
1202661,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,My favorite part about this machine it lasts all night because its so big! Very easy to clean and does not make noise,2,2022
1202676,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"This is a replacement for a product about 5 years old. From the very first it was a great improvement. The water chamber is larger. The steam therefore lasts longer. I was shocked at how quiet this vaporizer is. If I need to check it, I have to walk over to it, I can`t tell from across the room that it is on. I do not have to add salt to the water chamber. I have consistent steam for about 10 hours. I am happy about its locking feature, if I had children, I would be triple thrilled. A child could not open the top and or get burned by the hot water. If it is tipped over, the water level will turn the machine off.",2,2022
1202677,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,A very limited amount of Steam comes out even after the designated 6 minute waiting period,2,2022
1202678,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"When it worked, it worked well, although it`s kind of hard to clean the water reservoir unless you have a tiny brush. I had it about 2 years when it stopped producing steam. The newer, cordless model is worse though.",2,2022
1202679,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"I love this steamer! It heats up quickly, and produces a nice amount of steam. I have used it while breathing through my nose, and later I tried breathing with my mouth open - I felt it helped the steam get deeper into my lungs. After 5-10 minutes, I feel I am breathing much better!Honestly, I hold my phone and watch videos while I breath in the steam - it makes the time go so quickly.In the future, I will use this product any time I get a cold. I feel it is very effective.",2,2022
1205928,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,Since our table humidifier did not have a built in Protec .we added this item .just drop in with water filled humidifier.We have the one gallon.one.it has silver ingredient and other material for odorseem to workprice is good at Amazon,3,2022
1205935,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"After only a year of use the humidifier makes an horrible noise that sounds like the fan is about to lock up. I can no longer use it. For it to only have worked for a year this product is way overpriced. I would look at a different humidifier if you are in the market for one. I will ave to replace mine, and will definitely not be buying this one again.",3,2022
1205936,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,We r so dry here in texas and I keep my humidifier going 24/7 in living room!! My cats and dogs appreciate it to!! Couldnt live without it!!,3,2022
1205941,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Very effective; helps breathe better if you have a lot of sinus congestion; helps more if used 2-3 times a day,3,2022
1205943,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"This vaporizer didnt cost a lot, is easy to use and works quite well. I needed to add a little salt for it to steam and I have to refill it daily. I would purchase this item again",3,2022
1205951,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Just as described. I use it along with the vaposteam in the vaporizer,3,2022
1205952,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,When my child is congested the humidifier is what allows him to get a good nights rest. These little strips are like taking a good thing to a great thing. He even said mom I like the smell.,3,2022
1205953,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,These are all dry and the ones that are not dry only smell for about half an hour. Some of them are bigger than others and don`t fit correctly. When I buy these from Target they are 100% better; I bought these from amazon this time because it was a large box but I am now regretting it.,3,2022
1205961,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I love this. The old was was about 8 years old and finally bit the dust. I ordered the same model because I was so pleased with the first one.,3,2022
1205962,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"My husband had sinus surgery and weve had this baby cranked to 11 for 5 straight days! Puts out enough humidity to keep the air and his sinuses hydrated without making a gross puddle in the floor. Pro tip: weve been using distilled water to avoid any calcium buildup, but runs like a dream. Its not like anything could be heard over his snoring, but when hes awake, its still virtually silent. Would 100% recommend!",3,2022
1205983,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,"I bought this device two years ago, and after two years of good operation, it stopped working and when I tried to clean the electrodes, they broke.

1205997,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"Keeps a plastic smell for a long time, does not humidify the childs room as well as the comments indicate.",3,2022
1205998,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"nice little humidifier, the only negative point is that there is no night light inside that I thought there was... but good price, good quality... I recommend",3,2022
1206017,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"This humidifier does everything it intends to except for being quiet. Its output it a large stream even on low settings. Its beyond easy to use and impossible to mess up. But be cautious, if you are any kind of light sleeper or not used to background noises while sleep this product probably wont be for you. I dont have any surrounding noises around me while sleeping. Mostly complete peace and quite. So this humidifiers absolute constant motor grinding, whining and gurgling was beyond incessant. We gave it three nights and no one could sleep through its never ending noises in the bedroom. It does work fine in a living room, out of earshot of the bedroom, for us when the air is extra dry. It is barely noticeable within the sounds of a normal day. But light sleepers be warned, this isnt the humidifier for you.",3,2022
1206024,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"I got this humidifier for my baby shower 17 years ago for my first child. I loaned it to a friend that somehow lost it. She bought me a replacement and it`s wonderful. Excellent for people of all ages. The sound is not bad and actually quite calming. I would recommend using the vaper inserts. They`re wonderful with this machine. It`s so easy to clean as well...love, love, love it!",3,2022
1206028,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"Maybe they work? I bought them and put them in my humidifier. Didn`t notice a difference in anything, but can only assume that they work?",3,2022

1206045,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"This device works, but it doesn`t put out much steam! This device would much better to us if it was battery powered instead of hard wired!",3,2022
1206055,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I think it helps a lot to improve the air when you have the heating on. I used it the last days of winter and I felt better at night when breathing,3,2022
1206056,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Helps with my allergies,3,2022
1206066,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,A total waste of money if you plan on needing to use the medicated liquid. It steamed but did not seem to disperse any medicated scent,3,2022
1206075,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"I LOVE this item. I used humidifiers as a kid. Big, clunky, dangerous, leaky...This cool-mist humidifier is compact, effective, safe and even attractive.I`ve been using it to help treat dry-eye at night. It`s a winner!",3,2022
1206081,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"IT started smelling electric burning after a few uses,,A POS that should not happen",3,2022
1206086,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,People who said it doesn`t omit smell- not trueIt`s great if you do or don`t want nightlight ( it can be covered)When you adjust the smell( on both sides) it adjusts thr height of the pads ( for the slow people wondering how to put it in and take it out. )Reading is fundamental. There`s nothing wrong with the product. It`s fragrance is filling up my living room ( for those thay said the smell isn`t strong) . I`d definitely buy more.,3,2022
1206089,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"Good product. I wish there was a top fill so I dont have to flip it in order to clean and refill, also , that the light could be adjusted because it is bright. Maybe an option to turn off the light? Finally, it is quiet, but the noise can be distracting at times during the night. Aside from these things, Id recommend.",3,2022
1206094,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"I do not recommend this product . It has a strange, bulky structure which really makes it a pain to refill and a bigger nuisance to clean . It is heavy, especially with all that water. And it has too many books and crannies and generally bizarre engineering. I really do not recommend it.",3,2022
1206095,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"This was great during the winter. Lasts over 12 hours on high. We put a few drops of oil in the &amp;quot;cup&amp;quot; area on top of the vent, that doesn`t work great but this is not a diffuser. I`d buy this again.",3,2022

1206129,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,Very very noisy. Unable to use while sleeping due to the noise. Otherwise it is a basic humidifier - no adjustments other than the amount of mist.,3,2022
1206130,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Does not make any noise at all. Like the automatic shutoff. Easy to handle. Nice amount of spray.,3,2022
1206132,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Only thing I don`t like is the light. It is a good safety feature, so you can see it in the dark. But it`s bright. Would like it better if it could be dimmed. I`m not using in a kid`s room so I really don`t need that light",3,2022
1206151,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Easy to use and works great. quie and lasts over 12 hours on low settings,3,2022
1206160,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,I dont know who would give this anything other than zero stars. One star is way too much but that is the lowest you can pick. Do yourself a favor and boil a small pot of water and add some peppermint essential oils. Put your face over that with a towel around your head and that will help you. This thing is absolute garbage. It creates hardly any steam even after waiting six minutes for it to boil. Waste of money.,3,2022

When I opened up the filter, there were tons of hard, brown mildewy flakes and the entire filter was completely hardened with the brown mineral deposits. Disgusting. None of my other humidifiers have this problem. Seems like it`s a product defect. My baby has been sick, and I figured it was a cold, but since I`ve been using this humidifier in her room lately and just discovered the brown grossness, I`m now wondering if it`s related to the cough she`s had.

1206378,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"An error on my part, I didn`t take time to read if this item has an automatic shut off feature which it does not. This feature prevents the humidifier from running when empty.",3,2022
1206403,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,It works but it didn`t last long enough. There is plenty of water left but it stops working when it gets to a certain level each time. I`m looking for a larger unit same brand.,3,2022

I have had problems with coughing for months and have been using a cool-mist humidifier that did not help very much. I have a swollen inflamed larynx and the warm moist air has helped so much. I have it sitting close to my couch and keep it going all the time. Also, no filter to deal with. I wish I would have purchased this sooner.",3,2022
1206420,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Very nice, strong adjustable spray, easy water large water fill cap.DON`T BUY NON BRANDS, it will come from China and break very easily.",3,2022
1206422,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,It was overpriced for something that needs to be replaced every month and I still end up having to clean it every time it gets empty which is every 3 days,3,2022
1206423,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,It is cute to have a little fish swimming in the humidifier. They helped cut the build up from the hard water and kept the water smelling fresh.,3,2022
1206427,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,You need to use distilled water or it makes massive dust! I would not purchase this again,3,2022
1206436,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"I ordered this despite reviews saying it didnt steam. Im chalking that up to the visible steam you see on the packaging which is a little misleading. It definitely steams after about 5-6 minutes but its not as visible as the packaging. Youll see a lot of condensation within the mouthpiece and thats steam being released. I like this unit, although its a bit awkward to use if its placed on a table because youre kind of hunched over it but its fine. I feel like this is a lot easier to use then having to get steam from a shower and the vapopads that you can use are not overwhelming, they are soothing. My opinion is that this works exactly the way its supposed to work. The packaging should be toned down a bit since the steam is not as intense as depicted. I have awful allergies and sinus issues so this is just one more thing in my arsenal!!",3,2022

Then at night I fill it to the fill line and plug it back in. The first one I got stopped working within the first two weeks. Thinking it was a fluke, I requested a replacement. The replacement has lasted roughly a month and now the new one is no longer working.

1206455,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,Have tried many brands but this is very good; I have had more expensive brands. Do not like cool ones or ones with poor auto turn off when dry. I know the life span for these and don`t expect long life span. In winter run them 24/7. Find the brand trustworthy &amp; safe.

1206514,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"This is my first time purchasing this humidifier and I bought it because my family has had this model for at least 10 years now. There are two very important things to note about this humidifier:1. You can hear it run even on its lowest setting. Its not very loud but it is audible. It also occasionally makes a glug noise as water leaves the tank.2. Cleaning it every once in a while is mandatory. You can get away with it and be lazy, but there will be significant mineral build up that can damage the machine. Cleaning it everytime you fill up the tank or weekly will save you a lot of heartache later as this isnt the easiest to clean.My parents have kept the same one for a long time and even though its got its drawbacks, its a great machine for its price and the amount of water it stores. It got me through many colds as a kid, I would recommend buying the Vicks Vaposteam if youve got a particularly stubborn cold. There are plenty other humidifiers that are probably better but this one gets the job done (and well I might add) for a good price. The output is great and it can add a lot of moisture to a room quickly! My nose and tropical plants love it!",3,2022
1206544,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Love these! Super easy to use.,3,2022
1206545,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"Those that said the red light comes on for the first use are right. Mine also was defective out of the box. The manual says the red light only comes on if the machine runs out of water or if the heating element needs cleaning. The machine was brand new on my case, and I just filled it up with new distilled water also. I still dumped all the water out and checked the heating element - which was completely clean since it was new - and tried one more time. It still would not work, so I unfortunately returned it.",3,2022
1206550,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"I have two of those. We use them I would say 50% of the nights during winter.The last one I bought in Jan 2021 stopped working (turns on and all, but it seems the membrane does not vibrate strong enough anymore to create the smoke). I am out of warranty, this is disappointing.Other negative points: these are hard to clean up (bunch of hard-to-reach areas). If the clean up is not perfect... bacteria is just regrowing right away (I use special products, but it has a limited effect).On the positive side, I like the large capacity and the oil burner on the side.",3,2022
1206561,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Better than cold mist,3,2022
1206575,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,I mean if it actually keeps it clean then that`s always a plus however I wished it would move around inside for a little fun. It just stays at the top and does nothing whatsoever. Little disappointing I guess but again if its actually keeping it clean then bonus.,3,2022
1206576,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"What, exactly, is it supposed to fit in?",3,2022

1206580,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"This works perfect for my kids and me. When we are sick or our allergies are bothering us I use this at night. I have one in each room and it works like a charm. Easy to clean and fill up. Quiet enough to sleep, and a plus if you like white noise. I dont care for the bright light on it that shows its on but its easy to put something in front of it to cover. I would definitely buy again.",3,2022
1206583,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,This is not a typical steamer.,3,2022
1206584,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,I had another similar unit maybe from a different manufacturer which was twice the size of this one and had switches on the side.Shame on Vicks for making such a tiny unit without any switches!,3,2022

1206595,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Required a lot of water to function through the night- about 3 litres. I returned it for that reason and it was also difficult to clean. A lot of residue left over after just one night of use.,3,2022
1206596,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Long lasting, good quality",3,2022
1206610,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"So I`ve only had this for a month, and so far it`s working well tho the 1-star reviews make me wonder if mine is about to die! I`ve used warm-mist humidifiers before and hands-down the biggest pain is getting the lime scale minerals off the element. The easiest way to do it is the same you way you descale a kettle - buy citric acid (here on amazon in powder form is cheapest) and boil yr kettle of water, sprinkle about a tablespoon on and around the element and then pour in boiling water to cover the element. You`ll see it immediately fizzing as the citric acid dissolves the minerals. Leave it as long as you like and then empty the reservoir and towel off - the mineral buildup should be gone, but if not then at least it`s loosened-up and you can chip it away. Of course the more regularly you do it, the better. Anyway, just a helpful hint on getting the gross brown minerals off so the humidifier can do its job! :-)",3,2022
1206611,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"I was looking for a cold and warm humidifier, but after a couple purchases and returns, I realize hot and warm mist doesn`t really work since the mist will not be warm enough. I gave up and ended up getting this one that just has warm mist. It works great on cold nights and the room won`t be too dry which makes my nose bleed in the morning. The water tank is big so I don`t need to refill the water every time I use it. The noise level is a bit louder, but it not that big of an issue to me since I use ear plugs when I sleep. Overall great product. Much cheaper and better than the cold and warm mist ones.",3,2022
1206617,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Very easy to use and does a good job. I would recommend changing it often as humidifiers get dirty quickly.,3,2022
1206618,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Love the ease - just drop it into the water and you`re done. I even drop one in by the filter and it helps it to stay clean and smelling great.,3,2022
1206619,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,worked as described and a great value.,3,2022
1206621,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Had to return because the top part which holds the water did not come off to fill the water portion. Company was very kind an issued a refund.,3,2022

It is now March and I`ve been sick with flu that is also in my sinuses and it won`t work. The water is bubbling inside but not getting hot enough to put off any steam. I`m so mad. 8 steam sessions and it`s now broke when I need it most and it`s perfectly clean and the vent is open. Complete waste of money. So sick of investing in items that claim things are great in reviews when they are not and break quickly.,3,2022

I like the size, its not too big, but holds enough water that I dont have to refill every night, I refill about every four days. Regarding the noise level that others have mentioned, I use it on the low setting. The high setting is noisy to me, but I think that would be personal choice. I would buy this again.",3,2022

The first one lasted almost 3 years, which sounds like a long time, but it was ONLY used when we were sick in winter, which accounted for about 2 months time frame of possible usage, and that`s it`s not like we used it every day or even every week during those 2 months. Anyhow, we liked how it worked so when it died we bought a new one. Unfortunately the second model (same exact one) we purchased was NOT from Amazon, and when it died after only 5 months of owning it (used twice) the company said nothing could be done since we hadn`t saved our receipt for 5 months lol I asked for help fixing it - instructions, etc - nothing.

I need all the help I can get breathing clean air and it seems to be doing it`s job. Each fish last 3 months plus. So far I am just at the end of 3 months and looks like it can go another month. I am using this in a 1 gal tank. It doesn`t bother my Asthma or cause any other breathing problems as far as I can tell and I really like the little fish floating around. Haha",3,2022

To start it was difficult to get it boiling; the manual recommends adding salt, but that only helped a couple times all the days I used it this winter. Even then, the steam produced was much less than portrayed above and it only raised my humidity a couple percent, with the reader just a couple yards away. It also filled the water tank with dark flakes, which I assumed were tap minerals (though my teapot doesn`t have mineral buildup). In any case I then realized how difficult the design of the tank makes it to clean; the water swishes back and forth without leaving and gets trapped in crevasses. Also after using it about two months, it stopped converting any water at all. Maybe there`s mineral buildup on the heating coils, but I won`t know because the manufacturers lock you out with tiny star-head screws. In the end this helped me very little and caused trouble and may have wasted some electric.",3,2022

Willingness to settle amicably is appreciated but I consider the issue as unwanted, unnecessary hassle. Poor design/workmanship.

1207538,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Great product,3,2022
1207539,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,I bought this Jan 13th and it started making a loud noise on March 3rd. I tried fixing it but nothing worked. I was able to return it and bought what I assume is the newer version since I see its on clearance now. It didnt leak water and I liked the normal sound it made. The newer one now makes a gurgling sound when water drops I need to get used to that sound. I did like how the water came out the top. But I was upset it broke not even after having it for 2 months.,3,2022
1207540,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I love this humidifier use it every night and has helped me to feel a lot less st up,3,2022
1207541,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"I`ve had many humidifiers ranging from $10 to $150. This is the first one I ever had and after losing it in a move, I tried 5 or 6 others before buying one of these again. It`s simple to use, quiet, VERY humidifying, easy to clean, doesn`t leak, and the tank is a great size. I use it at night on high during the winter and it lasts about 3 nights between fills.I read some other reviews and frankly, it`s clear the people leaving bad reviews don`t have anything to compare this to or they don`t understand how humidifiers work.You have to clean any humidifier regularly or it will get moldy, just like anything else that stays wet. Here is how I clean mine once a week:- Separate the tank from the bottom. I like to use a Norwex bottle brush for cleaning the tank, it has a cloth pad that removes any mildew and bacteria effortlessly using only water.- The top directional nozzle is removable - I take it off and put it in the bottom part of the unit to soak- fill bottom unit with rubbing alcohol (or vinegar) and let soak all day- empty, wipe clean, and rinse, being careful not to get liquid in any of the holes leading to the motor- use q-tips to clean nozzle, corners, and crevices with rubbing alcohol",3,2022
1207542,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"This is a great unit! Whisper quiet, large enough capacity to run all night without refilling, easy to fill and no searching for the correct size filer. Cleaning the hard water buildup is easily done with vinegar and a non-scratch pad.",3,2022
1207543,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,So I received this yesterday and the water tank is cracked and leaks everywhere. But apparently its not returnable. So now I have a humidifier that is brand new and broken! Nice. Poor customer service.,3,2022

I followed the directions on the filter usage and it looks as if its going or burn on edges when I removed parts for cleaning. The vapor pads do not create any smell for me-I used it a second time and added my own essential oils to the pad and still no smell. Its decent to clean (weve used it 3 times now) but its too loud it sleep with even for my daughter who is used to sleeping with a fan on. And the humidity level does not change for us in her bedroom.

On the bottom where you twist up the little door to fill it with water is practically IMPOSSIBLE to shut completely without almost breaking your fingers and if you do shut it completely good luck ever getting it open.

1207868,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"In the winter when the heat is on, my sinuses get dry and I have nose bleeds. I have gone thru several humidifiers over the years. I liked this one because it had an auto shutoff feature. I purchased it in January 2021 and Winter 2021 is my first season using it. It works well but . . . when I set it on &amp;quot;high&amp;quot;, it`s actually kinda` loud and the water in the decanter does not last all night. I have to set it on the lower setting in order for the water not to empty out. I also noticed that the water reservoir cracked. NO I did not drop it. I think it cracked as a result of using it on the higher setting. So while I found the humidifier to be adequate, I am not thrilled with the noise level and the fact that the water decanter cracked. I am still using it though. Water leaks but it drains into the base where water collects to create the steam. I did like that it was easy to clean. Everything comes apart which is a major plus for maintaining it. So I think the pros and cons for purchasing this machine are a break even; it`s a reasonable price. I don`t recommend using it on the higher setting.",3,2022

The problem with adding salt though is that the Vicks Warm Steam Vaporizer will produce too much steam... and it will shoot water droplets out, which causes a puddle around the device and wet-spot on the floor. There is a cavity on the device head, where the steam come out from, that should contain some sort of not melting `filter` that can disperse the steam and route the water droplets back in to the water reservoir.

1208373,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Great humidifier especially for the price It lasts all night long and puts a good amount of humidity into the air I like the Vicks option but they dont really do too much I find unless your kid is right underneath it and breathing in the mist I purchased a different humidifier for our room than our kids and I regret it. the one I have is a bigger one and although it does blow humidity into the air but its heavy and the mist falls and makes the surroundings and everything it lands on wet. this Vicks one does not do that. everything is dry around it the mist goes up into the air and it stays there it doesnt fall back down so you dont have to worry about your surfaces being soaking wet. I regret not buying this one for our room as well but I will be in my next order. Oh and I think its important to note that I had bought this one from my first child four years ago and I still use it in his room,3,2022

I don`t have algae or mold grow on mine because I do clean it at the very least, once a month. I use it every single night. I also use it during the day when I have a cold. Its a pretty long lasting machine if it runs 10 hours a night for 56 weeks a year for 3 years. It is also very quiet because noise irritates me. It puts out a good amount of water too.

The red light turned off, and steam started to come out. This got me curious to why the red light was actually on, and turns out the light turns on when there is NO WATER.

1213478,2022 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"I prefer these over the sonic or heated humidifiers, as they are quiet and effective, at least when new. The problem is that the 2 electrodes inside soon get covered in deposits and stop working efficiently. Vicks suggests soaking them in vinegar often, but this is a huge pain - time consuming and doesn`t always get the deposits off. So every month or so of use I take the top apart and physically clean the electrodes.Unfortunately, the electrodes easily break (esp. if scraped too roughly) and Vicks doesn`t sell replacements. So - I have to throw out the whole plastic tub and top and buy a new one. Bad for the environment and bad for my pocketbook.An important tip: These can take up to 10 minutes to start producing steam. Be patient. If you rush it by adding too much salt, it ends up over-vaporizing and spits water all over. Plus it`s noise. And too much steam.Tip #2: There is no built-in humidistat.

1213652,2022 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"It`s also so much noisy than the prior versions of this warm mist humidifiers that I started using about 17 years ago. The manufacturer is the same and it`s branded as Duracraft, Holmes, Honeywell, and Vicks, etc. and essentially the same parts for the most part.I have tried the ultrasonic misting humidifiers but they have durability issues and they do emit a lot of white dust. I really wanted to love this humidifier but the burning plastic smell gave me headache and asthma. I have one surviving Duracraft DWM250 2-1/2-Gallon Warm Mist Humidifier from 13 years ago and originally had three of them and one my partner threw out when she couldn`t get it to work and another one that stopped working recently. I wish I could get more of them - they are quiet and effective while this Vicks model was noisy and smelly and I couldn`t sleep with it in the same room.I can`t seem to find a decent warm mist humidifier on the market now, so I`m going to go to try the evaporative kind.",4,2022

I used this after suffering for about 3 days of being diagnosed with the common cold and had a seriously congested head and sinus I put this inhaler on and IMMEDIATELY it helped clear up my discomfort. I was able to Breathe again and was able to rid my sinus of all the stuff that had been hanging up in there and it relieved so much.

Minimum 15 minutes a day for maintenance is way too much, especially since my room is still dry (a LITTLE less dry but not much).

Its not very noisy and has a couple different settings and then I like that it has the option to put the liquid vapor.

1213809,2022 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"I received this unit (Vicks Sinus Inhaler Model VIH200V2) a couple of days ago. Other reviewers have said that they received used units, but mine was obviously brand new. Other reviewers have said that there`s not enough steam, but mine provided ample steam for over 20 minutes the three times that I`ve used it so far. (I had the steam control slide all the way to maximum steam.) Other reviewers have said that the mask won`t stay on the unit, but mine is so firmly attached that it takes some effort to remove it. Other reviewers have said that the mask won`t fit their faces, or that it becomes distorted. It says clearly in the instructions not to touch your face to the mask, one reason being that heat could build up and distort the mask. Other reasons are that being that close to the steam could burn you or that blocking the opening of the mask could cause heat build-up to damage, not just the mask, but the unit. As with most things I have bought from Amazon, I find that if you read all the instructions and follow them, things generally work. I sometimes amuse myself by reading one star reviews from people who haven`t followed the instructions...and wishing that there were a way to interact with them to explain how that could make the product work for them.",4,2022

What I really love about it is the spout where the mist comes out is angled, it doesn`t just shoot straight up, and can be adjusted. It`s at the edge of the bed but pointed towards my son and it allows him To breathe it in directly. The night light is also very subtle, not too bright at all. Overall I definitely recommend.",4,2022

1213901,2022 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,I really like using this when I have a stuffy nose and need a little relief so I can breathe more easily. It works much better than a traditional vaporizer when you need quick relief.<br>I rated it 4 stars because its difficult to clean- our tap water (which is what the instructions say to use) is very hard and its nearly impossible to get rid of the white residue/buildup due to the shape of the reservoir and it cant be soaked in vinegar because the vinegar will eat through the coating.

Once the vapo steam liquid is added to water the mixture gets kind of milkly. The vapo steam did help me unstuff. I wasn`t coughing at the time, so I can`t vouch for if it would suppress a cough.

I have a couple other models of Vicks humidifiers with the same/similar opening (on the bottom), and sometimes they`re extremely hard to `unlock`.

When I first turned it on, I didn`t notice any mist coming out, but my husband convinced me to leave it on for a while because it is so quiet (which is awesome). I`m glad he did, because after a while the mist was visible and it has been running fine ever since.

1215375,2022 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"This product seems to do a better job of humidifying than the evaporative type and its a big plus that you dont have to keep buying filters. It would be very expensive however, to fill these with distilled water. I use filtered water all the time, from a Brita pitcher, but the scale still builds up on the heating element over the course of 5 to 7 days which requires taking the humidifier apart and descaling it. After about 5 descaling cleanings, the scale doesnt come off as easily or as completely as it did at first. Also, you cannot dry the area with the heating element by hand. It is hard to reach into the crevices where the scale collects.",4,2022

1215506,2022 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"It`s a nice buy. The water will last overnight and more without a refill on medium. Thanks for the Free Vicks pad. But it puts so much moisture in the air it`s not needed in my opinion.A major plus is, IT DON`T GET the surface and everything around it wet like people say If you follow the directions!I have my unit about 3ft from my nightstand and it doesn`t get moisture at all.* If you try to refill with water sitting on the surface it`s on, the water will spill out. This is because the base is full of water and when you place the top back on if the bottom isn`t empty then the water will overflow out of the base.When filling it up with water you must unplug the unit. Take to your kitchen sink or bathtub whichever is more convenient. Place the unit inside and make sure the cord is out of the sink or bathtub to avoid getting it wet.When you remove the top it will be water in the bottom of the unit. But it will not spill out. You have to pour the water out of the unit before putting the top back on after filling it with water. If you don`t the water will spill out of the unit. Clean the bottom of the unit then place the top with the water back on. DON`T overfill with water keep in mind that there is a chamber inside of the top that should not be under the water. You will hear the water filling the bottom up with water when you place the top back on. *Important the side of the top that has Vicks on it should be turned to the front of the base where the on switch is. It makes it easier to place the top onto the base without spilling water all over the place.After you hear the bottom of the unit fill-up with water, dry the access water off of the unit with paper towels. Remove from the sink or bathtub and place the unit back where you had it, and plug it back in.",4,2022

I bought two cool mist humidifiers a couple of years ago, but frankly, they`re too much trouble to keep clean. These, on the other hand, are a cinch to use. You may need to add some salt to the water tank (I did) to get it to generate steam. It doesn`t need much, though. (If it starts sputtering and shooting water out, you`ve added too much. Just empty some of the salted water out, add more tap water, and you`ll be good to go.) It does make some noise, but nothing overwhelming or annoying. Overall, this product comes highly recommended by me, at least. It does exactly what it`s supposed to do, is a snap to clean, and it lowers my utility bills by a lot. What`s not to love?",4,2022

The first time a small amount of salt worked and it produced nice steam . The subsequent times I had to add salt and a bit more salt to get it to work. Each time I changed the water, there was a fair amount of black sediment in the water which was alarming. See photo. I wondered if perhaps this was a returned item , since I have never seen black sediment in steam vaporizer water ever before and maybe someone else used it with high mineral water. We have city water with a brand new state of the art water treatment system .By the fourth use and minimal steam, it stopped working completely in the middle of the night.Now I am unable to return it for a refund because it it beyond the one month window for return.I am very dissatisfied and bought it primarily for the long trusted Vicks brand.I have had my previous steam vaporizer for over 30 years with zero problems .

I was hoping for a mobile/hand-held operations but the design is simply that you let it sit and bring your face to it to get the steam; it takes about 5 min to heat up the water and steam it, run for 20 min or so, and another 5 min to cool off to hanlde it (empty/clean/move). It`s still good, just hard to justify the price when general room coverage humidifiers run the same price or cheaper...

1218693,2022 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I suffer from intense seasonal allergies which usually leads to sinusitis and Im miserable until mid summer. However I decided to get this for my boys who were also suffering from congestion. This was a miracle worker for all of us! I love it the most obviously- we love the Vicks shower tablets but this is more direct steam right where u need it most. My littlest guy is 4 so its a tad warm for him but he holds his face away from the mask further. But it definitely helps him too! I went on Pinterest and found a post on how to reuse/ make your own vapo-pads so thats what Ill be doing. I love essential oils so as long as the unit continues to perform we will really get great benefits with this. The unit said it came with a free pad but It wasnt included in the box for mine. Oh well if you suffer from allergies or have a head cold/congestion - this is an excellent temporary solution to give you relief.,5,2022

1218739,2022 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"I was pleasantly surprised by this humidifier. It is cheap, it is kind of ugly, and very basic (a single knob that you can turn to set its power). But the water tank is very large, it is easy to disassemble and clean, and it can run non-stop on max for probably about 20 hours. Most importantly, it has helped reduce skin dryness -- especially on my hands and face. In Colorado, where humidity levels often fall below 15% I`ve had non-stop dry, cracked, bloody hands and occasionally cracks in my face. In my small-ish apartment about 650 sq ft) it is able to increase humidity up by about 10-15% overall to about 40-45% and then maintain that humidty level. It will probably work better if I were to close the doors to my living room / kitchen, but the increase is enough for me to notice a difference -- my skin cleared up quite a bit within a few days and I have had way fewer instances of bloody knuckles when I`m out and about. Yes, it sound silly, but it is awkard when you constantly end up with cracked and bloody skin or need to always have band-aids/tissues on hand just in case, despite moisturizing several times a day.Overall, for its cheap price this is a great buy. If you have a large house or apartment you will likely need more than one for it to really make a difference, but it should work great in a single large room or small apartment.",5,2022

1218984,2022 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"As a longtime user of various meds such as prescription nasal cortisone and antihistimine sprays, saline nasal rinses, decongestants, and even cortisone inhalers, I was surprised at how effective this steam inhaler is, especially as the first treatment in the morning. This was actually recommended by my ENT doctor. Not that all those meds he`d prescribed don`t work at all, but rather than waiting for them to work, a few minutes of steam has proven more effective--inhaling steam is like a pressure wash of your sinuses. You do have to wait 6 minutes for the steam to appear, but you can have it heating up while you make coffee or eat breakfast.",5,2022

1219196,2022 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"Gave this 1 star just so people who look at the bad reviews will see this.1) I can`t believe people don`t know what mineral scale is. Hard water has minerals in it. When you evaporate the water the scale is left. You drink these same minerals every day. Its NOT mold or mud. You can clean it with CLR and a butter knife.2) Leaks reported through switch are FALSE. The only opening in the `tub` is around the heating element and if it leaks there it will go right down on the bottom through the vents onto the floor. Most likely you don`t have the water tank cap tight enough or that cap gasket is bad. The cap must be TIGHT. If this is the leak, the water would fill up the tub and overflow the side possibly over the switch but its not possible for it to leak through the switch.3) The rubber gasket around the bottom of the heating element is squeezed tight by a plastic ring inside the unit by way of 2 screws. I took the bottom of the unit off by removing all the screws on the bottom. Not much inside. Just the power cord coming in going to the heater element and the switch. Other that that its empty. I found that the 2 screws were actually loose holding the ring on bottom of the heater element. I was able to tighten them about a 1/4 turn till they were tight. This is the ONLY place where water can leak THROUGH the base. Makes sense that they might be slightly loose after many heating cooling cycles. OBVIOUSLY I did this with the unit un-plugged. Just passing on information - you assume all risks for your own actions.",5,2022

1219272,2022 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,I love Vicks vaporizers. They seem to work the best and really are great with helping clear the kids airways while they sleep when they are congested.

My only complaint is that there is no on/off switch and I have to plug/unplug it before and after each use,5,2022
1219279,2022 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,I called Vicks to ask about the flaking of the heating element. They had no comment other that we license our name it KAZ. You have to unplug the unit from the wall when refilling or not using. I see sparks! When I fill the unit at the sink my hands get wet. I need to be sure they are dry when I plug in. So Kas would you like to take to me about a few safety and usability concerns? Free input. Lets improve a few things. Free consultation on my part.,5,2022

Don`t foget to put at least 1/2 C of water into the bottom (base) prior to attaching the top assembly (filled with water), that allows the unit to start producing the steam. Very quiet. Works fantastically to add humidity (cool mist) which is adjustable. In AZ so it is very, very dry. Noticed a difference with my dry eyes and skin not quite as itchy.

1219372,2022 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"I have serious sinus and allergy issues so a dry home adds insult to injury. This unit really improved my breathing and DEFINITELY helped my snoring. I use a neti-pot before bed, breathe-right strips, flonase, and general witch doctor chants but was still snoring enough to drive my gf nuts. This humidifier, coupled with the ability to use Vick`s Vapor juice right in the unit itself, was the total difference maker. The unit IS a bit noisy, I`ll start there. But once you`re used to it, it just becomes background noise... Barely noticeable anymore. If you use tap water (which I`m sure most of us aren`t going to constantly spend money on distilled to keep it full) it will start to accumulate hard water buildup on the heating element. I use a small wire toothbrush to scuff it off. I do that about once a month. That`s really my only 2 `complaints`...

It`s super quiet where you can have it running in the bedroom and it also has a large capacity of water so you don`t have to refill it very often. On full blast the water tank will last for about 20-26 hours at about 35% humidity but on the lower setting I`ve had it last almost 2 days sometimes.As far as cleaning goes it looks pretty easy but I`ve only been using RO water and find the need to clean it once every 3 months or so.

1219989,2022 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,I bought this hoping it was going to be like the one I got a afew years ago but it is not.. I used it twice and it didn`t even seem that it got warm enough to give off the vicks sent.. I don`t feel it is worth it. will not ever buy again... waste of money......,5,2022

Now, they don`t even fit properly inside my waterless vaporizer, and the scent doesn`t even last 30 minutes before it starts to dwindle and smell burned. It`s beyond disappointing. These are not even worth $0.99, much less the $8 per box they charge. Please, stop trying to cut corners and just make them like they used to be!",5,2022
1220020,2022 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"This product works best with the Vicks Sleep pads. Like other reviews, when changing the pads, do not touch them. The sent gets on your finders and can irritate your eyes if you accidentally touch them. Wash hands throughly. Good product.",5,2022
1220033,2022 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,It was working good but after one week it just stopped working Ive tried everything cleaned it very well made sure the water was completely drained out everywhere and the machine still wont work. Just took a photo to give you an idea how big the machine is its definitely on the bigger side and holds more water.,5,2022

1220060,2022 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Best one so far ! I had at least 8 different ones before I found this humidifier. You cannot go wrong with it. I bought a second one for another room. I would give more stars if I could.,5,2022

I just hope it doesn`t damage the machine, the instruction manual does not mention that it does to my knowledge.It comes with a vicks menthol tab to try, I was not sick when I used it, just overall congestionned and I`m not sure it helped more than just the regular humidity.It`s perfect for a bedroom or other smaller spaces.",5,2022

1220251,2022 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"This has nice images. Looks the same. Not working though. Added salt. It was producing heat and evaporated some. I could feel it ify hand was almost on it. Nothing visible in the air. Not noticable right next to me. Can`t feel heat or moisture. Added salt. Abit hotter, no steam still. When I see videos spurting water that might be worse. But it says to put it part way in to let it fill. I imagine it is like a fishtank filter. If you don`t fill the tube it spurts. Good luck",5,2022

1220290,2022 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Works as advertised in a small 1 gal kids room humidifier. There was no residue in the water tank after using this and we have well water. Our other larger humidifier definitely had some slime in the tank without the use of this product. Will be ordering more for the large humidifier.,5,2022

1220405,2022 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"Easy to use. Slightly bigger than a drink coaster. Very lightweight, feels cheap, even the cord is heavy enough to move it all over the place or flip it. The vapor pads are such a small amount that I couldnt tell if it was working at all. I actually looked for an expiration date to see if that was the problem. I also went to Walmart and bought new pad inserts and still didnt seem to make a difference. This was in a very small room for a child so to smell it Id have to try a closet. The light works well tho. so if you need a flemsy nightlight with a decent cord to plug it in then here you go. Id never suggest this other than an emergency with no other options. I still had to get Eucalyptus essential oils and a plug in oil warmer. Save your money.",5,2022

It puts out a great deal of steam and, it should work.But....the steam is way to hot, and the unit has a plastic smell that hasn`t gone away after four uses.I can only stand the heat and smell for about six or seven minutes. In that short of time, it does loosen milcus, but not like like steam from a hot shower. And definitely does not help like I was hoping, although it beats not having anyrhing at all.",5,2022

1223611,2022 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"I should have listened to the other reviewers, but I trusted the Vick`s name and took a chance. This steamer hardly puts out any steam at all to be very effective and you`d be better off covering your head with a towel over a bowl of hot steaming water. The plastics are very cheap `toy grade` quality so don`t expect it to last long before the plastics break apart. The whole product just feels cheap. Unfortunately this product cannot be returned for a refund so it was money wasted.",6,2022

I like the fact that you push the release button and take it apart easily and clean it. I run it every day.

Cons: - on the lowest setting the water still pools at the top (see photo) it doesn`t spill over, but I don`t know why on the lowest setting I still get a puddle of water. - makes noises. It makes a clicking/knocking noise at random times when the water from the base on top is allowing the water to flow into the base below. It kept waking me up the first night.",6,2022

It`s got a large fill opening and is easily broken down for cleaning. I like the warm mist over the cool mist models because the cool mist seems to leave a coating on surfaces in my home. The upright design is nice compared with the large, round models because it can be on any table, or counter and not take up the entire space. And most of all, this model, is affordable.",6,2022

Was a little worried because I was reading mixed reviews (more bad than good), but decided to get each of us one for our rooms and see how it went. Let me tell you -- amazing experience. Delivered with no flaws or breaks, instructions and set up were a breeze, each humidifier came with a sample insert for the Vick`s vapor tabs (VERY potent, btw. They say you can use 2, but one is more than adequate). Cleaning can be a little tricky due to small areas on the tank, but easily remedied with a bottle cleaner or something similar. All 3 are still running with no problems even with regular/daily use. No build up noticed even after I forgot to clean them for two weeks (instructions advise to clean weekly since there is no filter). Highly recommend!",6,2022

1224390,2022 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Purchased this vaporizer figuring that Vicks is a trusted name so it should work well. Boy was I wrong. The way that the water bottle attaches to the base is very poorly designed. It has a tendency to not sit flush against the back of base which then prevents it from seating properly on the bottom. It also leaks which seems quite dangerous. After using for a little while the red light would come on and the machine would stop working. This is only supposed to happen when the machine runs out of water but it happened seemingly whenever it felt like it. I ended up returning the machine and went with something else.,6,2022
1224395,2022 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,This product is not worth the money. The steam barely comes out and does not help decongest.Gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried it for a month with no success .,6,2022

1224794,2022 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,I bought this Vapor machine hoping it was going to work for long term. I opened installed got rid of the box follow instructions and the first night I could smell the Vapor steam of Vicks. Next the the water of the machine came out black it wasnt steaming all of if and I added salt has the instructions suggested. 3 day same thing it didnt steam the entire water that was black .it had stopped running although the green light was on meaning its still ON. Cleaned it with new water when to connect the machine. Turn ON for 2 minutes and shut down and it doesnt want to turn on. I can see the motor its dirty and thats whats turning the water black and it seems that this machine was used and returned and sell to me because I make the purchase online because the Walmart near me didnt have one on the store when I went to get it. Very extremely disappointing. Also I live in gated house so the should leave the packages outside if the dont fit through the gate. Who ever did the delivery throw the package . Thats it could also be a possibility to damage the machine.,6,2022

It does a great job of adding humidity to a bedroom overnight to help with the dry air. I sleep so much better and wake up with less congestion. A full tank on high will get you about 7-8hrs so pretty much lasts my full sleep. The only warning is DO be sure to use distilled water. I used tap water with my first one and dear god the amount of mineral build up on the heating element and components was unreal.

I really didn`t like the mouthpiece. It was electric and the button was easy to turn on. So Unfortunately it was accidentally turned on and burned the device up when the water evaporated. I didn`t have the money to spend on another electric one. So I decided to take a chance on this non- electric one. I love it. It works just as well. Has a more comfortable mouthpiece. Is easy and convenient ( no outlet needed. ) And much much cheaper.,6,2022

1229060,2022 / 07,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,It worked maybe 5 times. If you add a little salt it`s supposed to get the steam going but that has stopped helping.Also. You can`t really use it in the summer- the steam increases the temperature of tgevroom significantly making it hot and stuffy.,7,2022

Makes a huge difference in my sleep and breathing as well as headaches I sleep more restful and peaceful no more congested cough headaches or drainage. Make sure to wear gloves when handling the vapor pads or wash hands immediately after touching as it will burn your or your animals eyes if you rub eyes after touching vapor pads or if animals like your fingers",7,2022
1229195,2022 / 07,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,"I`ll repeat what I read and ignored...this is not a steamer. It`s really a diffuser of sorts, aroma therapy type thing. It`s basically a container you put a pad of medicated oils and such in hot water. You don`t need this actually, only the medicated pads really. You`ll get the same effect by putting the pads in bowl, pitcher or bottle. And the pads do give you a great Vicks aroma that can sooth your nasal passages.I also think that the pads would be just as effective if used in the shower. I`ve used Vicks tablets in the shower, but they are ridiculously expensive.So buyer beware, as long as you know you`re just basically getting a container to hold essential oil water, you are getting what you expect. If you are thinking this will give you a nice `steam` you will be severely disappointed.",7,2022

1229318,2022 / 07,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,I had one of these when my kids were smaller & it helped break up the cold. So I thought it would help when I got Covid. This humidifier is CRAP. It does not continuously steam well even with putting salt in it. You can only put so much salt in there. This is not worth the time or patience to even consider.

I had something close to this when I had babies 20 years ago.. thought it would be good for a child`s bedroom...NOPE!! This does not have a cut off switch or any switches at all.. to do anything you plug it in or unplug it.. so, to cut off you have to unplug it! To cut it on you plug it in.. says good for babies and children`s rooms, but says don`t leave children unattended! Don`t point near walls or furniture!! Mine didn`t mist out at first so I did what the manual said and add salt for trouble shooting!! I would say mine lasts about 8 hours running time. I`m still thinking about returning this... I don`t think this is the same that it use to be... I would not recommend this",7,2022

1229438,2022 / 07,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,For the price and size of this. Best one to get and can also add essential oil if needed. Has a small compartment for it. Easy to refill no spill at all. Tank has a handle on it to pick up and refill and put back. Throws out a lot of fog. I use this for my grow tent and does the job. On full setting the tank will last about 30hrs. But can last wayyy longer if turned down. I installed a hose on it for grow tent as you can see in picture,7,2022

I can not stand sleeping with a fan however I keep this on my night stand and it blows cool fresh air. Like every product with water and filters they do need changed and maintained but it is well worth the 6 dollar filter to change and does depend what room and how much dust is around. Without a doubt the best one I have ever bought. Sadly mine just broke after 2 years, my daughter knocked it off the stand and it fell on tile so unfortunately the top broke. I will definitely replace it tomorrow I can`t sleep without it.",7,2022
1229611,2022 / 07,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,This is not a vaporizer. It is is more like an ineffective scent diffuser. I had to open the unit and put my nose on the scent pad to even get a whiff on Vicks.,7,2022

1229897,2022 / 07,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"When I first decided to purchase this I was skeptical but more or less desperate to help remove the buildup of soap that had accumulated on my scalp due to shower pressure not being enough for my extremely thick hair at my new place. Had it for almost 2 weeks before even trying it out and the very first time I used it I was amazed how squeaky clean my scalp looked and felt. To be honest I really thought all this was going to do was give my scalp a good itch and possibly tangle and pull some hair out. I was completely wrong. I`ve used it about 20 times already on myself and my children and we never had a single issue. If anything my brush goes through my hair easilier now after a shower. It was easy to hold and maneuver, never tangled or pulled out a single hair, and the silicon is very gentle on the scalp. My 5 year old has a sensitive scalp and hates anything touching her scalp loves this. She even uses it herself. I`m really impressed and I don`t give 5 stars often on a product.",7,2022

1230741,2022 / 07,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I love this portable vaporizer..I have a couple 1 home & 1 in my car..I do use a microwave to heat my water..But I also learned you can cut these in half to get more for your money..works just as good as a whole pad...Because each pad is 1 time use..I also have the plug in on my desk at work...I have allergies & asthma & sinus troubles .The shower tablets also work well .You can break them in half also to save on money...Hope this was helpful.You can`t go wrong. You can use the liquid also if you run out of pads...,7,2022

It`s great for white noise on the high setting! (I live in a noisy area, so it is great to buffer out the sounds as I sleep!). Best part of all is that there is no more white dust from minerals in the water coating all of my belongings!! While those ultrasonic humidifiers may technically emit more water than this one, they also emit all of the minerals that are naturally found in your drinking water! Yikes, I hated the thought of breathing those in. This one has a filter, which is annoying to know that I will continually buy them, but thanks to another reviewer/ someone on the internet, I tried soaking my filter in soapy dish soap water and rinsed it, and good to go! Got myself another few weeks out of it. Overall, quality humidifier, I definitely can tell a difference when it is on vs off with humidity, and it can be very quiet if that is what you need!",8,2022

I`m not sure if this was a result of Amazon packaging it up for delivery or someone returned this item previously. Either way it`s unacceptable.Secondly, The Vicks Vaporizer was in the box but there wasn`t any Vicks vapo pads in it. There was supposed to be 5 pads.I did but a box of vapo pads when I purchased this item.So I decider to plug it in before I went to bed, I put a pad in it, and turned it on to the highest setting since my bedroom is quite large. I do like the soft glow of the night light.I laid there waiting to smell the Vapors. After a couple of hours, I still didn`t smell any vapors. I touched the device. The dang thing was ice cold. So it`s defective. I wasted my money on what I think is a used device that was returned for the same reason. I`m disappointed and appalled.",8,2022

I`ve never had problems with leaks myself, so I don`t know what that`s about.

I used vinegar as you do for many items that will house water youll be inhaling. The product is now worthless because I believe the metal in the water basin isnt really metal at all and the vinegar ate away at the martial. It wouldnt have been easy to clean. Any other way due to poor design. There is a large thing sticking up in the middle of the water basin making it impossible to clean around. Its too late to return it now and Im out $50 because I cant use this with the water basin material coming off and me risking inhaling it.

The top part of the heating chamber locks onto the base, creating a seal, preventing hot water from sloping out (this is a big issue with the cheaper model).-Overall this model is built a lot better and is easier to assemble and disassemble. It also feels like the parts wont break as easily.Cons:-Mask plastic is more rigid than the cheaper model and isnt as comfortable.-Steam flow isnt as strong as the cheaper model, because of this it doesnt feel quite as effective-Words and decals on the exterior rub off too easily, but luckily once you become familiar with the model the markings arent really necessary.Overall, even though this unit isnt perfect, I would buy it again over the previous model.

I filled it with water, plugged it in and nothing! I then noticed that directions on the container itself recommend you use `two pinches` of salt as it has to do with your Water levels (nonsense, our water is 100% perfect - should work with ANY water!) So I put in two teaspoons of salt and in about 5-7 minutes it finally started working. I wasn`t getting enough mist/steam so I added more salt and it improved (but you have to turn off the Unit - that can only be turned off by unplugging!, then you have to remove the heating unit in the center and re-insert the salt and mix!) I prefer not to deal with the labor! So bottom line, if you`re looking to save some money - yeah, this will work but NOT for all night. I filled my tank at 9PM and woke up at 11:30 and it had stopped working - the water lever had gotten too low so it stopped. BTW, there is no button to increase or decrease the mist.",9,2022

It just blows air like a small fan. Do not call yourself a cool most humidifier if you arent putting out mist. It doesnt feel like its doing anything at all compared to the ones I already own that after you run them for hours you can literally see the mist in the room like smoke.

Still see the light but it is now not so annoying at night. Secondly, and more importantly is the way it is filled. You have to completely removed the unit from the base, turn it upside down, remove the screw on door and fill it on the bottom before turning it over and reseating it on the base. Put the whole 1.2 gallons in it and it is rather heavy and bulky to deal with. Some seniors or women (sorry gals if that sounds sexist) may have trouble dealing with the weight.

1244812,2022 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,I usually like the Vicks products but this vaporizer wouldnt steam in the 1st 10mins so I added the recommended amount of salt and the thing started making ALOT of noise and spitting. Literally kept me awake so I had to unplug and return. Even in the photo theres no steam but noise.,9,2022

1244835,2022 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"Some reviewers said the unit does not have enough steams. I do believe it has enough steams if you wait for the recommended 6 min. Some complained the unit is leaky but the unit is designed to be kept level during use.<br>In my opinion, the biggest problem with this inhaler is that it has a VERY strong plasticky smell. Its likely the result that certain fire-retardant chemicals were added to the materials.<br>Unfortunately, these added chemicals could be very well carcinogenic that you certainly dont want to breath into the noise, mouth, or lungs. Also, I don`t think these chemicals are actually needed for safety purpose of the unit.<br>Washing and cleaning the unit will not reduce the smell. The only way to reduce the offensive smell is probably by exposing the unit under the sun for several weeks (UV tends to break down these chemicals).<br>In short I dont recommend this product, and you use it at your own risks!",9,2022

1244952,2022 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,I bought this without really thinking it through. Constantly boiling water bubbling in a very small base is not safe. Maybe on a kitchen counter sitting on a stool near an electrical outlet would work because it has a short cord. Putting my face near the small hood did not produce enough steam. Instead it was just very hot air that could burn your skin! The pliable plastic hood begins to emit an odor that you don`t want to be breathing. There was nothing relaxing in the whole experience.

The shelf was fully stocked and not out so there was no reason for a substitution. This has happened more than once in the past.. I know pick up is a free service but its really inconvenient to go inside to double check because I cant be certain thr associate just didnt look for the product.

We live in the mountains so we use this primarily in the bedroom at night, so, perhaps 8 hours per day. So, the first one we had, the fan started making noise and then eventually obviously died as the moisture would just kind of waft up out of the humidifier, not as it did when the humidifier was new and the fan actually moved the humidity up and out of the machine.",10,2022
1245814,2022 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"This little gadget seems excessive but let me tell you, when you are struggling to take a deep breath without coughing and your nose is so raw and red from drainage, it is a GOD SEND. This is not medicinal or going to cure your cold instantly, but it provide such a great relief from the most annoying symptoms of most colds and sinus infections. This helped me actually get to sleep when my nose was stuffed up horribly and my throat was raw. It is simple to use and help remove the worst of the annoying symptoms of a cold.",10,2022
1245815,2022 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"Its a tad big and has been a bit noisy, but my daughter sleeps better with less congestion. The vaposteam liquid pairs perfectly and makes the room warm and breathable.",10,2022
1245835,2022 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"This humidifier works ! It was purchased when i was sick and had major issues with my throat and sinuses while lying down. I was using it on low due to the reviews of wall streaks from the high humidity but I tried it anyway. Turns out the previous renters smoked . Now i have yellow streaks down that one corner where i have the humidifier. I`m glad it works so well. I haven`t had to Clean it yet but i don`t see it being an issue if i keep it off after the water runs out. It will be difficult to clean the water holding tank as it`s only a hole as entrance to it. I plan to use peroxide when i need to clean it. It is lightweight and works perfectly in a large room,on the low setting. Quiet, if you care about that aspect. Seems to run over 12 ,maybe 14 ,hours on low setting at full tank of water. I`d definitely buy it again whenever I need to and I`ve recommended it already to people. It works so much better than my other cute humidifier that is cold air.",10,2022
1245839,2022 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,After using this product for 1 night I woke up and had difficulty breathing. Could not take a deep breath at all. Ive never had any issues with my lungs so I can only imagine what it would do to someone with lung issues. It was really scary. I would not recommend this product. Left white residue all over my humidifier. Im sure thats what I breathed in all night. Hopefully no long term damage. Wish they listed the ingredients so I could at least know what caused my issue.,10,2022

1245872,2022 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,I was hesitant to order this with the mixed reviews and I should have listened to the negative. This item take longer than the 6 minutes to warm up and then very slow/minimal steam comes out thus not very effective.,10,2022

1245926,2022 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I bought this because my newborn developed a cold and it works great for alleviating her congestion. I did purchase the Vicks vapor pads along with it but even without them the humidifier works good. It also last all night when you fill up the reservoir.,10,2022
1245929,2022 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Very finicky going between distilled and tap water then adding salt if needed like directions say. Returned after couldn`t get vapor production a second time. Also it gets hot,10,2022
1245933,2022 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Bought it because my 2 month old plus myself had stuffy nose and low grade fevers. It did not throw much steam. I had it on for a good 6 hours and the room didnt even look humid. Dont waste your money.,10,2022

1245944,2022 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,The buttons are not sensitive enough I have to rub from top to bottom to get them to work. Power button is better but adjusting the humidity is hard. But I like that is easy to fill and clean. Its nice size but doesnt take up too much room. It also pumps out a good amount of steam. And the you can move the direction of the vent. Over its great just wish the buttons worked better.,10,2022

It lasted 24 hours before the red refill light came on and it WILL. NOT. GO. AWAY.I unboxed it, filled it with water, turned it on and it drained that entire tank in one non-stop run without issue. I then refilled it, it drained half that tank, and then faulted out. I`ve completely drained it, including the base, refilled it, and it just does the same thing. Red light turns on indicating it needs to be refilled. With a full tank of water. Of course I already threw away the box because &quot;it`s a Vicks, these things are bulletproof right?!&quot;",10,2022

But it is coming from inside the humidifier somewhere. Because if I tap the bottom a few times, more and more brown flakes are released into the water. I hesitate to use it anymore.

He should`ve read the reviews first. It`s got a large footprint, but I wouldn`t care if it actually worked. It doesn`t. There`s no on/off switch - you plug it in and it`s supposed to automatically start. Ours never gave off any steam. The `motor` feels slightly warm but not nearly hot enough to make steam. There`s a huge green light on the top that is so bright at night we had to duct tape a piece of cardboard over it so it wouldn`t bother my husband while sleeping. Overall it`s a very cheap model and I would suggest spending more money for a better-designed product that works.

1246782,2022 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,I dislike that its a fan instead of a mist. I also hate that I have to buy filters that are hard to find. Vicks has many other humidifiers that are much better!,10,2022
1246783,2022 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I have tried so many humidifiers after having children. This has a large tank and covers a large area. I keep this in my living room area and its perfect! Great quality!,10,2022

1246832,2022 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"This is a decent item for mild sinus issue. but I don`t like the amount of steam coming out. if you are suffering from severe sinusitis symptoms in particular, it is difficult to see a dramatic effect from this and it won`t help that much. It would be more effective to bring warm shower water to your nose. Because you can do it for a long time. So, When this product is filled with water, steam comes out for up to 10 minutes. it helps to soften the mucus to some extent (a little bit though I guess) for temporary. I used it in the morning and evening.",10,2022

Nothing happened, even when I added salt as per the manual. Sometime later, as I was about to throw it out, I decided to try it again. This time I filled it to the max line exactly and added 2 teaspoons of salt instead ( I don`t recall how much the manual said because I had already thrown that out but it was somewhere along the lines of 2pinches). As soon as I plugged it in it started steaming. Literally only took a few seconds to start steaming. I added a couple of menthol crystals and I got the exact reaction that I wanted EXCEPT, IT SPITS OUT HOT WATER. THIS IS A MAJOR DANGER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!

Noise level is very low and you dont even hear it.. Please do not believe other negative reviews. I`m using filtered water and hence i don`t find any mineral sedimentation. Haven`t tried normal water though. The mist comes out instantly and it is cool. We use it for our daily needs. its a highly recommended product.

1247846,2022 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"I highly recommend for anyone with allergies or sinus problems. Im sure it would be great for colds or illness also. I already had a steamer but it required standing over it. This one is designed to be hand held, so you can sit in bed or on the couch. It must be plugged into an outlet, but the cord is fairly long. I added a VapoPad and it was great! My only compliant would be that the reservoir only holds a small amount of water, so had to be refilled before I was ready to stop steaming. I am sure this is a trade off for making it small enough to hold in your hand. I absolutely love this thing! At first I thought it seemed a little expensive, but I think it is worth it.",10,2022

However, as some other reviews here noted the silver will stain the water`s path toward the filter and the filter itself a grey-ish color. It shows particularly much on the white plastic of the tank cap, filter housing, etc. I don`t mind, as some silver-salt stains are much preferable to slimy biofilm, both for the quality of my indoor air and the humidifier`s function and longevity.",11,2022

1250263,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,The power and flow level buttons are annoyingly tricky- you have to push lightly then swipe - and still it doesn`t always work. And then you have to wait a few seconds until the light dims before you can adjust to the next level. The motor is super quiet - (even quieter than the Vicks model with the blue tank) - However the sound of the water dripping/ trickling is very loud - it`s get softer the lower the setting - but the volume of the water dripping on it lowest setting is still louder than the blue Vicks` model on it`s it`s highest setting. Maybe some people find that sound soothing - but it`s random and inconsistent and I have trouble falling asleep to it. Gonna have to return it.,11,2022

The black stuff idk what it is but it does not seem at all like mold, I think it is just salt with color from the heating element. Yeah it is cheap plastic, that is why it`s less than 20 bucks. After than a boiling pot on the stove, and it makes my room feel like a bath house. Just what we need when someone is not feeling well at our house.

1250490,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"I like the device that it uses, as it doesnt require me to lug around a massive water basin around my carpeted apartment. The scent isnt as strong as I like it to be (compared to the basin thing) but it still does the trick, no doubt about it. It can go for hours and I still get relief from it.",11,2022
1250499,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Easy to use. No filters to replace. Top fill. Only issue is how often you have to refill it. It says to use tap water, which most advise using distilled, however I`d still use distilled especially if you have hard water.",11,2022

This humidifier works so well! Very quickly gets moisture into the whole room but without it being too much or causing any water damage anywhere. I`m so impressed. Sound isn`t too bad at all. Great white noise for sleeping. Pretty easy to clean, as the bottom hole where you put the water in is big enough to fit a hand. Super easy to use with just the dial you can turn to adjust how much moisture. Absolutely no leaks anywhere. I have it on my wooden table and have left it on for hours overnight with no issues or leaking. Seriously great. Highly recommend.",11,2022
1250626,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,This humidifier helped both of my kids sleep through the night with coughs. I recommend using this item with the Vicks Vapor Liquid.,11,2022

1250642,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,I have a love/hate relationship with this vaporizer. I love using the Vapo Steam with it but every.single.time I use the vaporizer I have to add salt,11,2022
1250648,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,"This product works nicely and for a good duration of time. Its very simple to take apart, but not so simple to clean and this thing needs to be cleaned at least every other day if youre using it on a consistent and or even all day use. It gets all calcified around the heater dome portion of it and its hard to clean and difficult to get your fingers around with a pad of some type (and I have small hands!) also, the handle bar on the water reservoir portion of the unit cannot carry the weight of the container its attached to when its full. My handle broke in half in the first week of having the product. Overall not the best, def not even worth the price Imo, but I needed something immediately and bought it based off some of the other reviews, and even back then someone mentioned its hard to clean. Which is 100% accurate. If you dont have the time or energy to clean, this is NOT for you! It will stop working after the first 3 days. Just be forewarned",11,2022
1250658,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"I can`t believe I spent almost $50 on this thing. The buttons barely work. You have to keep pressing them until you find just the right spot where something actually changes...if it changes at all. I`ve also had the humidifier stop spraying out the most, but instead sputter water out that doesn`t make it out into the air. Unfortunately, I`ve been stuck at home with COVID and really needed this thing, or I would`ve returned it. I do not recommend.",11,2022
1250659,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"The concept for this type of humidifier has been around for decades and this unit does it best. The KISS rule to the nth degree. Economical, quiet, no white dust because it works on a heating element that needs to be cleaned every once in a while with some vinegar. Has two settings and the lowest is enough for the largest room. Price is right. Just buy it.",11,2022
1250660,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,Full disclosure I got this humidifier at rite aid in clearance and was super excited I got it for 15 bucks. My son has cancer and has all ways had sinus issues and recently had his adenoids removed and still contsant snot. I give my life 1 star!,11,2022

1251125,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I did love this. Until now. It leaks. I had it on for a few minutes today in my bedroom -came back and there was a small puddle. Tried it again same thing. I bought this in December 2019. It should of lasted longer than this.,11,2022
1251141,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"My daughter got sick with the flu, unfortunately. Her doctor recommended buying a Vicks humidifier, so I decided to try this one out because it had great reviews. I have to say it has helped my daughter a lot with her congestion. We have a large room and we could smell the VapoPads (I got the lavender one) in the whole room. It even helped me because I tend to get nose bleeds due to the heater drying out the air. Also, I like how I dont have to constantly fill up the water tank. I had the vapor set to a little less than half way and it lasted me for the whole night. Im so happy with my purchase!",11,2022

The only thing I wish they would improve is filling of the tank. You have to lift off the tank and fill it through the bottom. I wish there was an access hole on the top. But overall, it`s pretty easy to fill and operate. The tank lasts a long time between refills.",11,2022

The label on the box as Steam Inhaler is incredibly misleading because even when I added almost boiling water, I could not get any steam to come out with the lid on, so I took the lid off and I might as well have just had a coffee cup at that point. It is a waste of money. Wish I had read the reviews.",11,2022

1251184,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Im not sure why all the negative reviews about this item. I think this warm most humidifier works amazing. My son had RSV and Covid together and this helped him so much with his cough. He actually stopped coughing at night. I highly recommend this humidifier. It lasted through the whole night and it was on the low setting and it was plenty enough warm mist coming out!,11,2022
1251186,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,If I could rate this zero stars I would. I used it twice and then it completely stopped turning on. I have no idea how its rated 4 stars.,11,2022
1251187,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,There is literally no mist coming from this humidifier. It`s also a waste to put the scent pads in because you can`t smell them.,11,2022
1251192,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,We have used this humidifier almost every day for 10 years. Only recently did the motor start slowing. I ordered a replacement last week and it stopped working after three days. I really hope I just got a defective one and these arent lacking in quality now. Fyi- the manufacturer KAZ is super helpful about replacing parts. The piece that regulates the water flow cracked and we were able to get a new piece for cheap. I highly recommend contacting them for any minor problems you might experience.,11,2022
1251193,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Found it helpful in dealing with a sinus infection. Help clean the nasal airway.,11,2022
1251203,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,We bought 2 of these. Both of them barely last 10 minutes then turn off because the flow mechanism doesnt let water into the lower tank. The product has a serious defect but cant return it due to it being a bit of time till we needed to use it. They both worked a few times no issues than bam both are paperweights. I wish I could leave a negative star review because these are junk.,11,2022

1251209,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"I was pleasantly surprised how well this helped clear up congestion! It was easy to put together and the instructions were easy to follow. It took about 5 min for the steam to start, and it produced a lot of steam. I liked that there are 2 settings for the amount of steam that comes out.",11,2022
1251214,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Works well to put humidity in the air. Does not get the floor sopping wet like other humidifiers I have used but I put a towel on the floor in front of it when I use for a prolonged time period.,11,2022

Hes autistic and has sensory needs, so suctioning his nose and spraying saline up it isnt an easy feat. After a long steamy bath or shower with Vicks shower tabs (running in the sink, not directly near him), we pop one of these in. Theyre VERY STRONG! Im not sensitive to scents normally, but if its too close to the bed I get a headache. I put it on the far side of the room and it helps him breathe a little easier at night. But its not a cure-all.",11,2022
1251238,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Purchased this and didnt think twice about the box being so light until I opened it and noticed there was only 1 pad in the box! So disappointed!,11,2022

Position your nose so that it intakes just above the mask. I like to clasp my hands, index fingers below my eyes, protecting my eyes from steam, pinky fingers touching the mask. The steam is coming out the top, not in the middle of the mask. Be above the steam to capture it. My upper lip is drenched in steam. The sinuses should be the same dripping in steam, loosing mucus, draining to reduce the bacterial load. ",11,2022

Received the humidifier in a box that appeared to be repackaged (the box was sealed with extra masking tape and the humidifier itself was in a plastic bag that was tied instead of sealed shut).

The other one could be refilled from the top, and it was really easy. This one has to be taken off the base, turned over, cover unscrewed, re-filled, and the process reversed. The water in the bottom of the unit spills if you aren`t careful. The tank is smaller, so although I run it on it`s lowest setting it goes through a whole tank every night. I would like to run it higher but it would run out of water within a short time. I like it okay but wished I had the other one back. I have thought about trying to drill a hole in the top so I could just fill it that way but am afraid I`ll crack the tank. It does work as it should, and it is very quiet.",11,2022

1251591,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,Bought this Dec 21 it is not Nov 22. Haven`t used it everyday. But during the remaining months of winter 21. Live in Arizona air very dry most of the time. Use it once the air gets that way as it keeps me feeling warmer inside the house. Also helps with my skin and sinuses. I just started using it again. Have used it for 3 or 4 days. This morning when I turned it on. It no longer works. Hasn`t lasted even a year though not used during the whole year. And yes I cleaned it and followed the directions. Is harder to get clean on the heating element that my much smaller cool air by another company and for a baby`s room. Won`t purchase another of this warm air unit. To bad. Maybe if it only cost a whole lot less I would reconsider,11,2022

1252097,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"The Vicks Personal Sinus Steam Inhaler with Soft Face Mask is a garbage product and it`s not returnable - stay away! It`s not designed to be held or to touch your face - look closely at the photographs and you`ll see that the models are neither holding the inhaler nor touching it to their faces, both of which it explicitly tells you not to do. And the body does get quite hot. So you`re reduced to placing it on a firm flat surface and awkwardly holding your face over it in a very uncomfortable position waiting for the tiny amount of steam it produces. It holds only a couple tablespoons of water, and it`s almost impossible to see any steam coming out even if set to maximum steam. I`d have to look past it to even tell if steam was coming out - couldn`t feel it on my face and certainly it never penetrated my sinuses. Even if I pressed my face against the soft face mask (which Vicks tells you not to do in spite of advertising its softness) I really couldn`t tell I was getting any steam. Then afterward you are forced to guard it, at least if you have pets or children, while it cools down. And the Vicks pads, well, just enough to provide the room with a hint of Vicks smell, I experienced no difference in use. You`d be better off heating a small pot of water over the stove, or using a room steam humidifier. You`d be better off using literally anything else. And did I mention that it`s not returnable?

1252168,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Takes a little bit of time to figure out how it works well, but it works great now. Love that it has no filter, great steady moisture coming out of you add a good amount of salt and keep the water filled. It does get hot, but it is worth it. Like the addition of the pads you can put essential oils on. Life saver in the winter and when you are sick. Yes it is kind of difficult to completely empty but just empty it the best you can and let it air dry. The black pieces people are talking about is just salt build up to dump out every so often.",11,2022

1252195,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"Yes - it works as a humidifier. Well, kinda. But the design is awful. Its a bulky tank. And its nearly impossible to empty all the water out. Weve had these floaties on the bottom (which likely came from the filter) that are impossible to get out. Were always left with a bit of old, stale water at each refill - the tank doesnt drain properly. Plus its difficult to clean. Its impossible to rinse out the old water and debris with this space ship container. Save yourself the headache - get another humidifier.

Remove the top half (the part that says Vicks), turn it upside down, open the port, fill with cold tap water. Optionally: add a few drops of essential oil directly into the water. (I use: 3 drops of Breathe available at Amazon. Ingredients: Peppermint Oil, Eucalyptus Oil, Spearmint Oil, Tea Tree Oil. Alternatively, I use 3 drops of Menthol oil.) Optionally: place a Vicks Vapo Pad in the little door below the on switch. Or, you dont need to do either of those things; just use straight up plain tap water. After adding my essential oil, I close the port, shake the contents, and put the top half back onto the bottom half. What I like is that this is a no-hassle device; the top goes right back onto the bottom, no fussing needed. Next, turn the on switch all the way to the right for 100%, and immediately cool mist comes out of the opening at the top. Its aimed at an angle so as not to hit your wall or ceiling; make sure it doesnt hit your tall furniture either. Put something underneath in case of a spill (I have mine in a glass pie pan).

My doctor has recommended one for years, but I didnt realize it would help so much otherwise I wouldve gotten one sooner. I live in Phoenix and its super dry here and Im prone to sinus infections. I have to say, this has been a life saver the past week. I feel like it really helped my congestion and helps me breathe easier at night. My only complaint is that it makes a pretty loud dripping sound, but I have a white noise machine I already use so I have just been turning that up a little higher and its been fine. I tried it with the Vicks vapor pad thing and love it, although they are pretty pricey. I have not had any issues with the buttons like others have mentioned.",11,2022

Then during the day almost immediately congestion came back so I moved this into my livingroom and congestion went away again! In the past I`ve only ever used a dehumidifier with vicks when my kids were little n sick. Never used it for me. From now on I will never be sick again and not not use this!! I`ve already recommended this to several people who have all bought it and thanked me for the advice!!,12,2022

If you put your face over the mask as directed, you will definitely be breathing in the steam. This is not designed to fill an entire room with steam like a larger vaporizer.

This has a knob that you turn to turn it on and adjust the level of mist output. Cleaning is easy. I just put white vinegar on a paper towel and wipe all surfaces. The top where you add water comes off easily and seals extremely well! It`s no trouble and it fits into its place with no hassle. I am well pleased. It works like a charm!,12,2022

Set it up on a small table and sat on the couch watching TV while I steamed my sinuses. I have asthma so I can really appreciate the steam to really open the air ways. This thing is dead simple to use. Fill it up with a little water and turn it on. Steam comes out until it doesn`t. I enjoy the vicks vapor but haven`t replaced the pad yet. I feel like its fairly subtle and that`s probably a good thing otherwise it would burn your eyes. This thing felt so nice I continued to use it regularly even after I got better. This steamer in combo with my netti pump made my cold super quick and easy. My only complaint is it`s got a cord and required me to run an extension cord to my couch so I can steam comfortably.

This was the only other option I found. It does increase humidity, but it has a number of cons: 1) it sometimes spits water out of the front, and the water is very hot! This seems like a safety issue. 2) The power cord gets very hot, like there`s too much current running through it. 3) It seems to only run for about 5 hours even when filled all the way, so unfortunately I still wake up at night with uncomfortably dry air. 4) Sometimes it vibrates in a way that makes an obnoxious sound. 5) I`m not sure what the black stuff is that is always leftover in the water once it turns off, but it`s a little concerning.",12,2022

I haven`t had any problems with it so far. I love that I can put the Vicks pads in it and that it`s large and holds enough water to run all night. I do have to put salt in it every time I run it though to get steam to come out. All in all though I`m happy with it compared to other humidifiers that are more pricey.,12,2022
1253521,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,1) it doesn`t use VapoPads 2) the blue letters that say `VapoSteam here` with a little arrow is literally melting off like magic marker 3) getting the vape steam in the little holder is nearly impossible without over spilling & it takes like 5 drops 4) you NEVER smell any Vick Vaposteam which is the whole reason you buy this product - so basically USELESS unless you want an expensive steamer in your room and 5) you CANNOT return it - which is a ripoff in my opinion.

You also should be cleaning your Humidifier about once a week. if you use this Humidifier all of the time.If you do this your Vicks Humidifier will work great for years. also for cleaning if you live in a dusty house take some canned air and blow out the fans to clean them out from dust. simple maintenance and this unit works great. change the filter every 3 to 4 weeks. you can buy replacement filters here on Amazon. my unit has been working since 2020.",12,2022

It`s a simple machine so I don`t understand why it is so pricey. It was purchased on December 29, 2021 for $35.99 using rewards, otherwise I would not have made this purchase because I thought it was just too expensive for what it is.

I`ve used the provided `pads` and also just a small dollop of Vics, or essential oils such as Olbas Oil and added boiling water to fill line. It`s just a wonderful steamy vapor for my congested lungs and nose. Be careful when you first inhale so you don`t get too much steam; it is easy to pull your mouth just a little bit away from the mouthpiece to control the amount of draw.

1254031,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Vicks` signature vaporizor updated slightly to provide a few more options for medicine delivery and a night light.

1254143,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Steam level? Cant see or feel it. Doesnt even steam the vicks product insert cup on the top. Filled up about 60 percent and felt the water went away in 60 minutes. I honestly felt so unsafe because it would be going with no water. The water just went away so fast!!! I DO NOT recommend unless you want to babysit the product as if there isnt a ton of others things to do on a daily basis. Tightened the top the same tightness it came and the water spilled out. Instructions stated dont tighten too tight. Instructions and product are dumb!,12,2022
1254146,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"This does not use the carbon rods many others do and is very easy to take apart and clean. I`ve learned that paying extra for a water de-ionizer filter really helps. Our water is hard (measures 450 TDS) and the ones that use carbon rods will last about one season even when taken apart and cleaned very regularly. My water filter brings the TDS to zero (meaning I`d have to add salt to get it to work with the carbon rods type). This one has a heating element that will develop a thick crust if used with our standard tap water, but really shines using the de-ionized water. The warm mist (i.e. boiling water) means that unlike the cool mist humidifiers, you needn`t worry about bacteria being sprayed around the bedroom. This helps a lot in the winter and will help keep you healthy. You need to clean this one regularly still, but it is easy to take apart and requires no tools to do so.",12,2022

1254196,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"In a ridiculously stupid redesign, they made the top of this unit all curvy. The problem with this is that you need to turn the water tank upside down to fill it, but of course it won`t sit flat anymore. It`ll still stay upright--it won`t completely tip over--but it sure wobbles like crazy. It`s a little harder to get at the heating element on this version to clean it, too, although it`s kind of a hassle either way. You do have to clean it, though, or it`ll build up a bunch of scale and get worse at producing steam. All in all, I guess it`s okay--it does the job it`s supposed to do.

1254333,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"This review is for the VWM845 model that has the inverted heating element that is located in the vertical tower of the humidifier. This model is extremely difficult to clean properly due to the inverted heating element. I also had the prior version of this humidifier that located the heating element in the base, and the prior model was easy to clean because you could just pour a bit of descaler in the base and let it sit for awhile and then rinse. Since the new version uses an inverted heating element, this is not an option, so there`s no way to remove the scale from the heater. There is also a plastic removable screen over the heating element that accumulates scale like crazy and is also impossible to clean due to all of the small holes.",12,2022

This new vicks humidifier is only a month old and has not really worked correctly since it arrived. It barely creates steam, and stops after the water line drops an inch. Adding a little salt does not improve it. Adding a little more and it suddenly spews water everywhere. I run this every night as our home is dry in the winter, and it runs next to my bed.

It is very easy to use and does help when you are dealing with a sore throat or congestion. I use the vaposteam liquid which lasts quite a while, as so does the steam from the humidifier itself. I can leave it on the highest setting for 8+ hrs if I fill the tank up, will definitely last longer with the lowest setting. I honestly dont find it that loud, just sounds like a very low humming at times. In the three years Ive had this, I never experienced mold, malfunctions, leaking, or anything bad. Even with the new one I just bought, it is still performing the same as my old one with no problems. Also this has been a god send to me as I just got Covid and didnt wake up with a sore throat or dry mouth. Very much reduced my coughing and stuffy nose.",12,2022

I like the vapo pads slots too but for some reason they dont last very long. Its also good to have the vapo pad slot on the bottom of the unit just in case if one goes out of stock.

A substantial amount of water in the tank is not used because the vaporizer. Therefore, the advertised volume of this tank is irrelevant because it is not the amount of water being vaporized, which is deceptive. Also, particles from some portion of the device contaminates the water with each use. You actually have to clean the tank after each use throughout the day, which is impossible to clean everything out the way the tank is designed.

1255566,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"I love this little steamer. It helps with my constant sinus issues and headaches. It does take a bit to start steaming, but once it starts its awesome.",12,2022

1255581,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Works great!!! I havent tried it with the Vicks solution or pads yet! Hopefully its as easy to clean as it appears and using white distilled vinegar ,12,2022
1255583,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Works great, cost is exceptional.",12,2022
1255585,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,"There are no filters for this anywhere!! Also, there`s mold less than a month after using it. The filter constantly smelled like the inside of a fish tank. I returned",12,2022

1255590,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"I needed a WF2 and these seemed to be an option from what I read online, but these are thicker and stiffer and hard to install in the humidifier. Sometimes they don`t even absorb water...maybe not quite reaching the bottom/water reservoir? I had one sit for days and it was barely damp on the bottom and dry above that. My humidifier was just blowing air!",12,2022
1255598,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,The only problem is not easy to clean,12,2022
1255599,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,The unit is continuously on while plugged in. To turn it off it needs to be unplugged there is no power button. I have never in my life seen any appliance work this way. Completely insane. That being said it also will not shut off when the water gets too low. So if you use this for sleep and it runs out of water it will just stay hot. Huge safety hazard. Does it make steam? Yeah. Am I gonna risk it to use it? Absolutely not,12,2022

1255609,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"I got this for my son because with radiators running in the house along with cold weather, the air is super dry. I`ve had the larger Vicks humidifier in the past, but wanted something smaller. I love that it`s super easy to fill up and dump water out. I also love the touch feature for the nighlight where you can pick the color or you can shut the light off as well. No con`s thus far :)",12,2022
1255614,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,"The touch control panel on the one we bought didn`t respond to touch very well, To change dispersal rate setting we had to hit the arrow dozens of time before the lights indicated a change. The power control acted the same way, had to keep hitting it and eventually the machine would start or stop.",12,2022
1255615,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"Ive only used this humidifier twice and as I was trying to use it last night for my child, it didnt work! I dont even have the box to return it anymore! Im really upset.",12,2022
1255618,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"Works well, lasted all night.",12,2022
1255627,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,I bought this for my son who has had a cough for about a week. I`ve tried adding the pinch of salt as it says and it let out some steam and then nothing. The only thing that works is the nightlight. There isn`t even an on or off switch. I wouldn`t recommend it,12,2022

1255646,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,Its a very good product for the price. however there is no on/off switch. you have to disconnect the plug before taking out the heating coil/unit. Wish there was an on/off switch.,12,2022
1255654,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,This humidifier is awesome. Fills the whole room for my kids and it`s great that I can adjust the humidity levels. Will buy again!,12,2022
1255659,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Stops working after about 5 minutesthe red light comes on for auto shut off which is only supposed to happen when the water tank is empty. This is happening brand new out of the box and with distilled water. I guess I have a lemon but this is very upsetting I have to not go through the hassle of a return.,12,2022
1255677,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"Was very easy use, but to no good,,pad smelled like Vicks ,not very strong,, air coming out of unit(vicks unit) had no oder.. my evaluation ,, do not wast your time , and money on this .",12,2022
1255690,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"This fish does an excellent job. People who are complaining of mold and some who have posted pictures, I suspect, do not understand how the fish works. Here was my experience and the reason I love this little guy. I filled my brand new humidifier and used it for maybe a day (a night). I actually thought it was empty or I would never have unplugged it and let it sit for THREE WEEKS with some water in the tank and the actual humidifier. When I went to use it two days ago, I pulled off the tank to go and fill it. Imagine my surprise and disgust to find that the bottom part of the humidifier, not the tank, was moldy. I cleaned that with a combination of white vinegar, baking soda, and peroxide. The bottom part of the outside of the tank also had some algae growth but nothing too concerning. But the water tank and the water left in the tank itself with the fish was completely clean. Nothing in it no growth no nothing. The poor fish though? I shined a light in on him and he had been working some serious overtime! I wish I had taken pictures before I tossed him out. Little guy was mostly green and black with some lighter spots in his guts and he definitely soaked up all of the nastiness to keep that tank clean. Had he been made to be outside the tank floating around down in the humidifier I fully believe that would have been clear and clean too.",12,2022
1255699,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Just like the title says you get your humidifier out of the box, set it somewhere preferably on a dresser for us debility you undo the cord and plug it into an electrical wall outlet or otherwise known as a wall socket you wash the filter meaning you wet the filter and Try to find a filter to replace it. This is the easiest humidifier Ive ever experienced. It sounds like a leaf blower and after a while it started making some strange noises on low. It was very quiet. It wasnt that loud on high and then you turn it off the Vicks vapo pads Worked",12,2022
1255702,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,The high setting never works for me I constantly have to take it apart to clean it. Do not buy I was really disappointed it only worked once after that the light kept turning red. The low setting doesnt even let out any steam. High setting does if I could get it work longer then 5 minutes,12,2022
1255709,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Purchased this for my sons room to increase the humidity levels during the winter months. No more dry air and no more built up static from the dry air. Easy for him to fill and clean. Nice having the option to add Vicks products when needed.,12,2022
1255722,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"Almost immediately after getting it, the filter became moldy and smelled nasty!",12,2022
