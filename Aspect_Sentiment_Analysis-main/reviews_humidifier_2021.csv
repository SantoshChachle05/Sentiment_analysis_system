1101431,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,easy to use and does the job,1,2021
1101441,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,"Bought this at the end of 2019 and used it for two months. Took it out for winter 2020 and used it for a few weeks, and discovered that the coating on the heating element is flaking off! Cracks running through the coating and actual chunks of gray plastic? Teflon?Im not sure what the coating is made out ofare in the water well. Terrible!! The humidifier worked ok the first season and still outs out steam even though its broken, but I would not want to keep using it. Who knows what this damage would do? Dangerous!",1,2021
1101442,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Great product! On low definitely lasts the entire night. Using the vicks in the top cup is a HUGE help, do it!!!",1,2021
1101453,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"I stopped using it for six months, and when I pulled it out and turned it on it didn`t function. Cheap junk.",1,2021
1101457,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I have two of these. They are easy to use.,1,2021
1101489,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Great product, we bought a second right away for traveling! Very easy to use, only down fall is its a little difficult to clean. But great price for our money.",1,2021
1101490,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"This product was obviously engineered to overheat internal plastic components so that they produce stinky, probably cancer-causing odors. Do not buy at any price!!!",1,2021
1101494,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,Did not say to order the Vicks pads that go with it. One came with machine. Works great with ir without.,1,2021
1101495,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,This is perfect if you have sinus problems.,1,2021
1101496,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"I used these on a Vicks humidifier. They had a few drops of moisture inside the sealed bag which should not have been there. I have ordered these through another vendor and had the same problem, not sure why. I let them sit out and dry before I used them. They help stop white dust.",1,2021
1101505,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"I really like this humidifier. Its so easy to fill and easy to clean. We use ours almost every night and have had it for about 9 months. Only issue we had was originally using tap water to fill it (like it shows in the pictures) and it caused a horrible film and even after cleaning multiple times, it never really went back to normal. I called Vicks and they sent a new one out right away (great customer service) and we have had no problems with the new one since only using distilled water.",1,2021
1101506,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,"Seems to work well, but no matter what I`ve tried, I can not make the gurgling noise stop. Wanted to use this in my bedroom, but I cant with the noise it makes. Look a diff model if you want a quiet unit.",1,2021
1101507,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Had this for years! No expensive moldy filters to replace. Easy to use and clean. Tip: use distilled water to prevent sedimentation and itll run forever. Relief from dry nose and throat in the winter; eases breathing and reduces irritation to help avoid colds and flus.,1,2021
1101515,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Very nice quiet works perfect in any room,1,2021
1101516,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"For the first time in months, I woke up with no nosebleeds. And my husband didn`t snore!! Wish I would have gotten it sooner. I chose this one so if I get sick, I can utilize the Vicks vapor too.",1,2021
1101527,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Humidifies my living space enough to stop static.,1,2021
1101529,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,Its does the job but takes a little more time to warm up than expected. Good for the price tho.,1,2021
1101530,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,It is easy to use and clean but noise level is high. I do not like the light limitted from the this humidifier. it is too bright so it bothers me while sleeping.,1,2021
1101531,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Easy to use and refill. I run on high and it last about 10 hours between refills.FYI - When it runs out of water it smells like you`re scorching your clothes ironing.Only has the small opening so cleaning inside will just consist of a good shaking for several minutes.Only enough output for a small room.,1,2021
1101532,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"Like someone else posted mine too arrived broken. Flawless boxes so I don`t know just fragile I guess. Very thin brittle plastic holding the whole rear half by one tiny &quot;latch&quot; if you want to call it that (see pic, that tiny square hole is the latch). Awful design. Got a replacement coming but Im sure its made the same way and hopefully not broken. I will hand it to amazon for a quick replacement(put claim in sat, replacement arriving monday) and easy to just bring the old one to kohls to have them ship it back.",1,2021
1101533,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I really enjoy this product. Its silent and auto shut off. I just received it aunt Ive been using non stop since. Might purchase another one.,1,2021
1101547,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Helps with keeping the air from drying out from my furnace, helping my overall breathing. I didnt realize it had a vapopad in it and I think I threw it out so be careful.",1,2021
1101550,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"My husband and I were congested so I bought this in place of a humidifier. I used both vicks pads that come in it, and we put it on max & didnt smell it at all. Not worth the money.",1,2021
1101561,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"Great product. Wish they were scented more, they dont seem to last an entire night and they are little pricey.",1,2021
1101562,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"These pads work great to help with my daughter`s congestion. Word of caution, however: when I ordered these through the normal process, I got the correct item. Through Subscribe and Save, I got the regular pads instead of the lavender/rosemary ones. Not worth returning, but I definitely canceled the subscription.",1,2021
1101571,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"Works well, but there are a few issues with leaking. There is nothing that locks the tank into the bottom of the humidifier so when the water from the tank drips into the bottom of the machine, nothing is sealing that water off. Which means every time you move the humidifier or bump it slightly get ready for leaking everywhere.",1,2021
1101583,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Eso es todo una estafa no sive para dada,1,2021
1101587,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,this is a great vaporizer use it every day,1,2021
1101592,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Very comforting,1,2021
1101593,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Exactly what I needed to for my Vicks Inhaler.,1,2021
1101605,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Absolutely love this humidifier!It says its for a small room but we use it in a large room and its wonderful. Its not loud at all and the light is perfect in place of a night light. Its great because it doesnt have a filter.We did leave it on high once for a day and it filled up the entire house with a lot of humidity!!But that can be changed by the setting. Of all the humidifiers we have had- this one has been the best!! Love it and would buy this again!,1,2021
1101607,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,My husband and I have sinus problems . When they get bad we use this it helps a lot.,1,2021
1101617,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Used it with my humidifier and it worked great,1,2021
1101621,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Super portable! Grab n go when I travel too.,1,2021
1101622,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,It works fine but do not think am NOT getting effective use of medicine cup it is not getting enough heat or able to disperse the oils I am using into the air flow just evaporatesGet better cleaning of scale by using baking soda instead of salt . . Salt builds crystals and baking soda remains scale,1,2021
1101623,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,Worked perfectly for 2 winters. Now it makes a loud buzzing sound. Took it apart and cleaned the dust off and its still sounds like I`m going on a loud car trip.,1,2021
1101629,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,This vapor producing machine is UTTERLY SILENT and will add moisture to your bedroom air all night long!,1,2021
1101630,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"This is such an affordable solution to my winter issues, namely dry skin and sinuses. It`s very easy to use and very easy to clean. The unit makes a soft sound that is similar to a white noise machine, which is very soothing when trying to fall asleep. So far I have not seen evidence of leaking, but I keep it on a tray just in case (actually I am using a baking dish and it works great). If you have hard water, I recommend cleaning twice a week because the calcification will end up harming the heating element if you let it build up too much.",1,2021
1101631,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,The sound is too aloud at night,1,2021
1101635,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Easy to use. Steam is nice and warm. Wife and I have been using this to help our dry and stuffy nose and it helps with wifes chronic bronchitis. Overall, helpful to have in our home. It looks durable and easy to clean. Thanks.",1,2021
1101664,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Rating provided by a verified purchaser,1,2021
1101665,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,This humidifier works great. It sends out moist air thru a very quite fan that you canu2019t see instead of a vapor mist which doesnu2019t spread far. It covers our large bedroom and the reservoir only needs refilling every other night. Definitely worth it.,1,2021
1101679,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,The item is a gift. She stated it works fine.,1,2021
1101698,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I thought it was smaller but it works great :),1,2021
1101708,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I use this in my humidifier and I get the relief I need. I enjoy the smell from this. It doesn`t bother my allergies or sinuses. It definitely helps my cough and dry throat. And it can be used every day if I need to.,1,2021
1101709,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"We do like Vicks products so we bought two of this vaporizer for our newborn however with this specific item was different. It does work couple of times and then it seems like needing more salt, we added salt accordingly to the manufacture manual and started spitting or just not working, so if we added not salt it wouldn`t properly work, and some salt added it won`t work either. :/",1,2021
1101717,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,Very easy to operate.,1,2021
1101718,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I love these things. My family is always suffering from congestion because of allergies etc. these little babies are the bomb! They help so much!,1,2021

1101786,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"I have a furnace humidifier, but it`s never helped my night time congestion. I often had a raw, bloody nose. This warm-mist humidifier is only used in my bedroom. It`s amazing how much it`s helped me. Of course, I keep my bedroom door closed at night to concentrate the humidity.",1,2021
1101787,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"Broken leaked, messed up my table",1,2021
1101788,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Louder than other humidifier we have... thankful it is easy to clean because we have hard water. After 3-4 weeks of continuous use it must be cleaned. Really appreciate the automatic shut off.,1,2021
1101823,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"I really love the design, fits nicely in any space",1,2021

1101835,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"This is my favorite type of warm air humidifier. I always buy an extra one, just in case something happens to our main unit. Cleaning this is a breeze, and it truly lasts all night long, even on high. The light is a tad on the bright side, but it`s easy enough to turn the unit towards the wall to help block some of it.",1,2021
1101837,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I felt the difference immediately. This was a great investment. Now I can breathe at night.,1,2021
1101838,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,"I brought this not even 6 weeks ago. I use it in my bedroom when I feel that the air is too dry. It`s got distilled water and I don`t use it every night. I was satisfied with it while it was working. Turn it on last night, it gave a groan and that was it. DONE! No mist, no motor running. For the price, it`s not worth it.",1,2021
1101847,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,Still get the same mold in my ultrasonic humidifier after using this cleaner for a few days. A bit expensive.,1,2021
1101855,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Love this product,1,2021
1101856,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I love these vicks pads! So easy to use and different scents available are great!,1,2021
1101869,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"This humidifier worked really well... until it didn`t.The unit was fairly easy to clean, although it seemed to accumulate pink/red bacteria a lot (and required A LOT of Qtips to clean completely). The unit was quiet, and usually lasted for a day and a half to two days on about 50%.But now when I turn the unit on, the motor makes a loud, constant buzzing noise, meaning that something is clearly going out on it. Time to find a new one, won`t be buying this one again.",1,2021
1101877,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"I love this , helped my baby and myself sleep when sick. Great valve for your money!",1,2021
1101878,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I love the product I just wish that had more pads for the price,1,2021

1101903,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I love this humidifier. It`s extremely simple to use and works really well. It got rid of my red eyes and dry skin I had in my ears due to too much dry air in my house before. I don`t have any eye issues anymore and my ears are healing. It`s easy to carry and does it job extremely well. It`s a game changer.,1,2021
1101904,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,Very large tank that is easy to fit your hand in to wipe out and use is super simple - fill it up turn it on. You can hear the water bubbling more in this one. If you`re someone who always has to go when you hear running water this might not be the product for you.,1,2021
1101907,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"Maybe its a great product, but for sure not a one-size-fits-all situation. Just make sure the hole is big enough!",1,2021
1101938,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,These are lifesavers for kids. I keep them in stock for my son who is under 6 and cannot have nighttime medications. These keep his cough quiet so he can sleep when he has a cold and helps with the nasal drainage to prevent the coughing and it all works without any medications. When he has a bad cold I will change these out when he starts coughing again and it quiets it back down to sleep through the night. These have been a huge help since he was little and had RSV at 10 weeks old and I have been using them ever since.,1,2021
1101955,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Good quality easy to use not too noisy ...a little gurgle of water every once in a while but nothing annoying good size for bedroom,1,2021
1101956,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,This humidifier used with the Vicks VapoPads helps me get the uninterrupted sleep I need each night.,1,2021
1101957,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,This item broke a few months after I got it. I didnt bother doing my review because I was aggravated. Its really a piece of garbage.,1,2021
1101961,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"I will be returning. There is a label on the side that says it will not allow humidity to go over 55% as it could damage walls, etc. Im not sure if I just got e defective one, but this thing barely makes any mist/steam. I used it In a 27x27x66 well sealed area, but I could never get the humidity up enough. no gauges on this one. Goes thru water very fast as well, I would not want to leave this thing alone for 12 hours, and I need something that can go on its own. This was not it. This didnt work for what I needed it for, and I tried it bedside, but it wont even build condensation on the palm of my hand when I put my hand directly over it, let alone humidify a bedroom. Going back. I got a sonic one, with a gauge so I can set it and forget it, and that produces more mist with less water for longer. There is no comparison from that to this. Sorry vicks-I tried u cause you are a name brand, but you let me down:(",1,2021
1101962,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Disappointed Use this item 4 times before it Completely stop working.Not recommended.,1,2021
1101963,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,Easy to use humidifier but it`s just too loud. Not suitable for bedroom use. Woken up by it multiple times at night.,1,2021
1101964,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,So far so good! Using this has helped put humidity into the dry indoor winter air and makes sleeping easier. I also don`t wake up with a dry throat.,1,2021
1101965,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,"Lasted about 3 years then it fried. There`s no resistor or fuse that I can replace to keep it going, so I must buy a new one. When it was working it worked okay, it`s fairly quiet, but it did leak water several times on my floor. Going to go with a different brand for my next purchase.",1,2021
1101966,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,Easy to use.,1,2021
1101979,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"This is such a great humidifier, for all of yall saying it molds and all that its kinda common sense to get some kind of water protectant to keep it from molding. It is a HUMIDIFIER, something that always sits in water no matter what so without some kind of treatment to protect the water from getting moldy it will 100% get moldy its common sense. I use the PROTEC brand fish things to keep mine from ever molding they last for a month u just have to replace them. Ive only had my humidifier get grungy maybe one time in the MONTHS I have had it and as soon as I put a treatment in it, the grunge immidiately goes away and it never has mold. I have never had to physically clean my humidifier before, EVER.",1,2021
1101980,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"I am about 4months pregnant & caught a terrible cold. I was having trouble sleeping at night despite my medicine because I felt like I couldnt breath from how congested I was. I slept like a baby first night of use! It was so simple to set up, the directions were clear. I followed them exactly & it lasted ALL NIGHT surprisingly. I didnt have to get up in the middle of the night to add more water or to add another vicks VapoPad. I am amazed at this humidifier would def recommend.",1,2021
1101982,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Best one I`ve owned so far , as for cleaning the hard water off of the heating element there all kinda difficult",1,2021
1101983,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,Really irritating that it cant be filled in my sink!,1,2021
1101984,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"Emits a weird plastic smell. Maybe that goes away in time? I had to stop using it because of the odd burnt plastic smell. Sure, unit is easy to use and functions fine. Is quiet enough. Chugs out the vapor faster than other brands. This is the first one Ive purchased that is a warm mist. I dont like it. It feels like a stifling hot room in need of fresh air. Was hard to breathe normally. Felt like a nasty humid southern summer night just begging for the rain to finally show up and cool everything off - but there is no rain.",1,2021
1102000,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,It was so cute I dove right in. I have a Vicks humidifier with a small opening on the bottom. Front of package and description clearly says Works in most humidifiers. I will try to find a home for it. Although I was wondering how cute they would be in a small tank with a filter running.,1,2021

1102002,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"I`ve been using this vaporizer now for over a month. It is extremely quiet so we don`t even know its running. We fill it once a day. It has cut down so much on the static electricity in our house, which is the reason we purchased it. We haven`t used it for medicinal purposes so I can`t weigh in on that. I highly recommend this product. Thank you",1,2021
1102006,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"I bought this to prevent the pink mold that ends up on water well on the humidifier. It does stop the mold,but mineral deposits end up on the machine. For the price, it`s not really worth it.",1,2021
1102007,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"This item does it`s job, fits, the holders , in most humidifiers, but way over priced..double what the competition is !!! Go fish , half the price..",1,2021
1102010,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Not worth it at allSteam even doesnt come out very hell product,1,2021

1102035,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"It has been awhile since I used this product (as you can tell from the original package expiration date). Different product/package design, but works the same. Using in a VICKS Cool Mist Humidifier, Model 3500NJUV. 1 has definitely lasted more than 8 hours. Room size will definitely affect the menthol `fragrance`. Would definitely consider buying again in the future.",1,2021
1102039,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,"I bought this is 2019 and first year it worked fine but now it gives low reading compared to other units I have and even placing it next to humidifier does not do anything, I put new batteries in it and still the same. Don`t waste money on this unit. I am sorry I bought it now. Example: another unit will tell me humidity is 45% this one says it is 29% and no way to get it to read better. Frankly I have have seen other units that read better for less money so do not wast yours on this...",1,2021
1102040,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Even though my water is very hard I had to add salt to this to get it to work at all. This is recommended in the manual as well.

The two settings are nice, over time the first setting will get the job done but if you want you room humid faster the second setting does the trick. You can notice the difference and its definitely a preference thing, obviously the second setting is more moisture. The noise isn`t bad, especially if you like white noise, but other than that it really isn`t bad. This thing was life changing is all honesty.",1,2021

I cleaned it before 1st use as always vinegar solution first, then soap and water. The smell of overpowering plastic is horrendous. It even over powers essential oils placed in it. Each time I take the fill tank off to fill and go to replace it, it is a constant struggle to get it to sit down into the unit completely. Of all 3 units, this being the 3rd, this is the only one that has a handle that sits down into the unit, not sure if that is the problem or not, but know that things do not line up.

Some humidifiers really make some noise when they`re going and this one is silent. It holds a lot of water and can run for a ful day, so I`ve worked refilling it into my nightly routine. As with other Vicks humidifiers, it has built-in features to use with other Vicks items. I like this because I do have quite a few Vicks items, especially with reviewing.

1102211,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"Have been wanting to invest in a humidifier for use during the winter months for awhile now and finally settled on this one. Easy to use and does the job of humidifying as expected. I especially love that you use water straight from the tap as opposed to having to spend even more money for water. The only drawback for me is that although the humidifier has a specific place for using Vicks VapoSteam or Kaz, it really is of no benefit at all. Even the measurement given in the product instruction booklet is somewhat misleading as it calls for one &quot;Tablespoon&quot; of inhalant, but the tiny space called the &quot;medicine cup&quot; would barely hold a whole &quot;teaspoon&quot;. Not only that, the inhalant really has no heat element hitting the cup directly, so we were not able to even faintly detect the inhalant being dispersed into the air even after several hours of use. This is a nice product for sure, but definitely not worth the money if you are looking to use the added benefit of something like Vicks VapoSteam.",1,2021
1102214,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Works as expected and very effective. It can be. used with or without the Vicks vapor Pads for inhalation. Very good control of the intensity of the steam. Highly recommend to use for inhalation therapy. Sorry, no images.",1,2021

1102238,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"First I bought the AquaStick for my 1-gallon ultrasonic mist humidifier. I put 2 in per the instructions, and it made absolutely no difference -- brown/pink slime appearing within a day, and absolutely disgusting and desperately needing cleaning within a week (as usual).Then I decided to try this one, even though it`s more expensive and says it doesn`t last as long. But this one actually works -- I`ve had it in for 2 weeks and only now am I just starting faint traces of brown/pink. The advertised silver content is something like 10x that of the AquaStick, so that might be the reason? Anyways, this is actually worth it -- it`s making a HUGE difference in keeping the humidifier clean, and I don`t have to worry whether all that bacteria slime is getting in my lungs.",1,2021
1102241,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,"An earlier reviewer said the magic screwdriver for removing the two top screws are #27 torx. I got the variety pack of torx bits just in case that was wrong, and it was wrong. See my photo -- #27 is gigantic. These tiny screw-heads are #10 torx.I purchased two vaporizers at the same time, started using them at the same time. After two weeks, they both started failing -- no vapor output. You can see in two photos that the electrodes are apparently made of some kind of soft material, and they quickly deteriorate in two weeks (of continuous use). I am not filling the vaporizers with hydrochloric acid. I have a water filter on my faucet that reduces chlorine. If anything, the electrodes should be happy about reduced chlorine.What I didn`t show in the photos is all the black chips that fall off of the disintegrating electrodes that accumulate inside the electrode compartment, which somehow blocks the flow of steam. In fact, I have a kill-a-watt meter hooked up the vaporizers, and the vaporizers can draw the full 300 to 400 watts of electricity, you can hear the water boiling inside, but no vapor comes out, and the proof is that the water in the tank get used VERRRRY slowly. But the electricity bill remains the same -- big waste.The maintenance procedure I`ve developed is this: Unplug the vaporizer from the AC electricity. Bring the vaporizer head over to the kitchen sink, because it`s going to be dirty. Unscrew the #10 torx screws. Separate the blue top from the bottom electrode compartment. Do not drop the Torx screws down the drain. The bottom electrode compartment is just a plastic shell filled with black chip debris.When the top is separated from the bottom, there is not much holding the nightlight assembly to the blue top. Try not to unseat the nightlight assembly from the blue top, but if you do, it all fits back together easily.If your vaporizer stopped working, chances are you`ll find the electrodes exhibit deterioration, as shown in my photographs. RESIST the urge to remove chips and scales from the electrodes -- removing the scales will accelerate the end of the electrodes` lifetime. Let the chips and scales fall off on their own -- the cheap, made-for-planned-obsolescence electrodes don`t need your help to disintegrate faster. Don`t even try rinsing off the electrodes -- they don`t need help falling apart. Instead, treat them delicately, don`t bump them into things, try NOT to loosen any chips and scales that haven`t completely fallen off yet.The scaly chips that have accumulated in the electrode compartment are hard and rough, maybe like lava rock. It`s probably not good to let the pieces go down your kitchen drain, so put the strainer onto the sink drain to catch the chips. Then, rinse the fallen scales and chips out of the electrode compartment. They should fall out without resistance, like pouring rocks out of a pail, just the force of running water to get the little pieces. It`s not worth doing a spotless job, because there`ll be more accumulation in a couple of weeks that will need to be dealt with.Reassemble the blue top to the electrode compartment. Make sure the nightlight assembly is properly seated in the blue top. Don`t bump the electrodes as you`re inserting them into their plastic compartment, because that will hasten the electrodes falling apart.I find that emptying the garbage out of the electrode compartment is all it takes to get the vaporizer working again. BUT, that will only work as long as the electrodes have not yet completely disintegrated. At some point, there`ll be nothing left but a couple of 1 inch stubs, and the vaporizer will stop after the water level has fallen 1 inch.I grew up in the 60s with a Vicks vaporizer that lasted for decades, when they were Made In America. Apparently, the electrodes have been reformulated so instead of lasting forever, now they last for 1 or 1 1/2 winters. Last year, I threw out a new vaporizer before I learned the weird screws can ",1,2021

1102490,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I was weary based on other bad reviews but this thing worked great. I initially put the water in and no steam. I started with adding 1/4 tsp salt and had a little bit of steam and added another 1/4 tsp and had the perfect amount of steam. The instructions advise to start with 1/8 tsp. Our congested baby slept all night with this. It may just be a fluke but two exhausted parents are very thankful. I used it the next morning and it still steamed great with only adding water. The negative complaints seem to be only from people not reading the instructions. The manual says that black particles in the water are normal and do not affect the purity of the steam. The unit seems pretty simple to clean as its only made up of 2 parts and there are specific instructions for cleaning. Im so impressed with this and especially because of the price compared to the cost of other humidifiers. I cant speak to durability and how long this will last but it has done its job well.,1,2021

If you have this issue, try lightly hitting the top of the unit after refilling the tank to get air bubbles out of the opening.Basically when there is still water inside the base, air can get trapped inside the opening in the tank and the pressure difference between the tank and atmosphere isn`t enough to force them out. If you get the bubbles out by giving the unit a smack, it works.Vicks should make the plug open more or enlarge the hole to avoid this problem in a future model.Otherwise, the unit is excellent, especially for the price. Relatively easy to clean, quiet, and runs a long time on one tank even on the highest setting.

So far, it works as described, and the gallon tank is enough to keep it working all night long. I like the fact that you can use tap water, which saves quite a few $$/week. However, the cleaning is an issue. The water in my city is so hard that the heating element is perpetually covered with a rock-hard white deposit which cannot be wiped off with a damp cloth, as the instruction suggest. The other plastic parts can, and they need to be cleaned weekly at least. At one point, when I removed the plastic shrouding and chimney, I saw that a hard calcium deposit had actually fallen off the heating element during the night and was preventing water from circulating around the element. That was easily fixed, but I`m still not sure if it was supposed to happen. The only other incident was one night, when it ran out of water, and I could smell a distinct burning odor before the unit shut down. I make sure it doesn`t run out of water now, and so far, no repeats of the odor. I wish the instructions included more info about how to clean the scaly white calcium deposits off of the heating element. Hopefully, that will not become a problem as time goes on.",1,2021

1102845,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"I bought this one day when my old humidifier broke and I was desperate. It was cheap. But little did I know it was going to be the BEST humidified ever.I actually talk about this humidifier a lot. I`m not crazy. It makes a huge difference to have a great humidifier.I live in New England and my house is really tightly sealed. Our primary heat source in the winter is a pellet stove. Needless to say our house is DRY in the winter. And we all suffer from it. I used to have warm mist humidifiers and never had a problem with them but that was in an old drafty house. When I brought them here they molded very quickly and I found myself replacing the filter every 2 weeks. And then the filter became impossible to find because these companies like to change the models up every few years to keep you buying new humidifiers. I switched to cool mist but eventually ran into the same filter woes.SO when I discovered that you could have a humidifier WITH OUT a filter...you can imagine my excitement.This humidifier is quiet and powerful. On full blast the tank lasts about 6 hours. Mildew does accumulate if you don`t clean it. Like anything with water does, duh.Once a week I collect the humidifiers from around the house (we now have 3 of them) and I clean them with hot water, a non abrasive cloth and a teeny tiny drop of dish soap. I rinse them well and then put about a cup of vinegar in the tank with some cold water. I reassemble with humidifiers with the vinegar in the tank but I DO NOT RUN THEM. (This is all in the manual. Read it.). I let them sit for about 30 minutes. And then I empty them, rinse them and lay them out to air dry for the rest of the day (shown in picture). This has kept them mildew free and they smell great. The hardest part to clean is the tube shaped canal that the steam travels through. A large bottle brush works great to keep it clean.This is my second year with them. And I will be DEVASTATED when I have to replace them.I read some of the negative reviews of this product and look....If you think you can a humidifier (any humidifier) for days or weeks on end with our cleaning it, you are an idiot.

1102908,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,The heavily-scented product does fill the air without dissipating too quickly...lasts for hours. I used it at bedtime which didn`t work for me.

You will only feel the effects of moisture if you`re within 10 inches radius, 24 inches vertical, of the vent where the mist escapes up top. Sure, it is soothing with the optional mist pads but that`s about the only good thing this product has to offer. It`s cumbersome, water spills easily and just outright ineffective.

I can not stress enough to make sure you are taking the top parts off and cleaning this machine.

It` barely affects the dry air in our master bedroom. Recommend another product if your need is for medium or more humidity change in your room.The design has 2 pinch points on the center (heater) unit for your finger to grab the top for removal. Between the (smooth) plastic and shallow pinch points, while it`s easy to twist the component, actually being able to lift and remove the unit (to add/remove water) is a pain. You need fingers of steel to get enough grab. This is even harder/awkward if your finger is even slightly wet.LED is always on and bright.

I used the vapo pad that came with it and thats great, if that wasnt in there I dont think this product would be good. The vapers from the pad are strong like menthol so you can feel that go through your sinuses. It says not to rest your face on the mask part but I did the 2nd time (I put my chin on the bottom part) so there was definitely more steam going in my mouth and nose, otherwise theres not a lot of steam even on the highest setting.

1103450,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"[Why I bought this product:] I`ve suffered from chronic post nasal drip ever since I was a kid. Amazingly, it went undiagnosed all the way into my adult years. Symptoms include: chronic cough all day long (imagine how awful it is to have this during COVID--you get stared at a lot, even though you know you aren`t sick), waking up in the morning with lots of gunk in the back of the throat, stuffy nose in the evening and/or morning, and overproduction of mucus.[First night using this humidifier:] I noticed a difference after the first 1-2 hours the machine was running. I woke up in the middle of the night, noticed my throat didn`t feel gunked up, and I wasn`t coughing. It was a strange relief. I woke up in the morning and did not have a stuffy nose. I felt great![The good:] It doesn`t take long for the mist to start coming out. No leaking, no mess, and it`s easy to fill the tank with water. I use distilled water so that I don`t have to worry about mineral buildup. I suggest everyone do that.[The not-so-great:] I want to preface this by saying that I don`t consider this a deal breaker. If you are very sensitive to light, you can block it by putting something in front of the dial. Anything ~6x6&quot; or more would be big enough. It`s a little noisy, but I got used to it after 30 minutes. It`s no louder than a ceiling fan.",1,2021

1103453,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"Works great, this is a second one for us. Only complaint compared to the older model is that they`ve made the opening of the tank much smaller.

The warm humid air makes the room temperature feel warmer than the cool mist humidifiers which make the room temperature feel colder. There is no white particulate expelled like the cool mist models.

After about 30 minutes in the humidifier it was a pleasant and definitely there smell, but just fine for her, she fell asleep with it in the humidifier. When we awoke in the morning, the smell had permeated the house through her closed door and was giving me a headache in my room, which is down the hall from hers. I went to wake her up and the scent hit me like a wall when I opened her door. She had gotten used to it through the night but after having breakfast was overpowered by the smell in her room and had to let it air out. Next time we will leave it in for only about 10-30 minutes and take it out before bed. A lovely scent, it is very pleasant, but these are VERY STRONG SCENTED, be aware!",1,2021

1103907,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"I invested in this humidifier, but the first day I used it, it only worked for 4 hours before the steam shut off. confused I refilled the container, follow the directions to add a little bit of salt, and replugged it in and again it only steamed for 4 hours then shut off.

After adding water and flipping the on switch, it takes about 15 minutes to generate steam.However, it is not as effective as the old Conair personal steamer that I used previously. The Vicks Personal Steam Inhaler, V1200 does not produce nearly as much of the warm/hot soothing steam, even with the vents wide open. The Vicks scent pad (there is only one provided), creates only a light scent and did not comfort.The unit is also manufactured by Kaz, rather than Vicks.",1,2021

1103939,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,I like this humidifier. The noise level is bare minimum. The only thing I hear is like a soft bubbling sound from it.

After 5 minutes of it being turned on, the red light indicating the reservoir was empty came on despite the tank being full. I followed the reset instructions and it worked a little longer but turned off sometime in the middle of the night even though the tank was no where near empty.

I am very pleased with my choosing of this specific one.Besides the price being extremely good, it also runs fairly efficiently. It holds a decent amount of water, and can run up to 20 hours on low. If you run it on high it will require frequent refills but that`s expected. My ONLY slight complaint about this is it is a little noisy. I had been using a VICKS vaporizer which generate no noise, and I`m certain it is normal for them too so I don`t know if this qualifies as an accurate complaint so.....Regardless, I highly recommend this item for anyone in search of a humidifier for their little ones nursery!",1,2021
1104086,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Great humidifier for my twins. We use this for them when they are sick and it helps. Great buy and I love buying things that are worth it.,1,2021

1104089,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"It`s pretty quiet. It says its steam is &quot;up to 95% bacteria free&quot;, which I guess means it`s at least 5% bacteria. When I used to grow bacteria in a cell biology lab, the flasks full of bacteria and an optimal bacterial food, kept at optimal bacteria-growing temperature, were probably about 5% bacteria. So &quot;up to 95% bacteria free&quot; is not a glowing recommendation.It isn`t easy to clean. Every time you use it, you have to take it apart into 4 different parts, which don`t come apart quickly--you have to bend down to the floor and fiddle with a spring-loaded closure mechanism twice, once for each of 2 different parts, and then set all the parts out somewhere--where? on the floor? on the sofa? to dry before the next time you use it. That`s not even the cleaning; that`s just the daily airing-out. The water container, when you clean it, has lots of difficult-to-reach nooks and crannies. I`ve read that you can avoid needing to do that if you always dry it out between uses & add something like alcohol or hydrogen peroxide to the water.If you don`t use distilled water, and your tap water is &quot;hard&quot;, the heating element quickly gets covered with minerals from the water, and you`ll have to scrub that clean pretty often. That`s better than having the rods that get mineral build-up hidden, like in the simpler vaporizers, which you must either take apart and clean every few months, or throw out after a year.If you use distilled water instead, that`s $1 a day to humidify one room.Finally, being an evaporator, it burns electricity. On setting 1 it uses 125 watts; on setting 2 it uses 250 watts, or 1 kilowatt-hour per night. My cool mist humidifier uses 6 watts on setting 1, and 10 watts on setting 3.",1,2021
1104090,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"Basically works as advertised, but it`s really really tiny. You`ll need to refill it very often. From the photos it looks exactly like a dehumidifier that I had and was really popular a couple of years ago. Turns out it`s more like a half size scale model.",1,2021
1104091,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"The noise is too loud, sounds like you are boiling water next to the bed. I can even hear it from a distance. Might be ok to use if it is for general use but definitely not suitable to use at night or in the bedroom",1,2021
1104097,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"First of all, hot boiling steam is dangerous. Reviews that comment on this criticize unfairly. Its hot steam! Yes its dangerous. I was throwing a towel over my head and inhaling the steam from a boiling pot of water on my stove. I bought this because I thought itd be a little less dangerous for me and my family to use than hovering over a hot stove. Unfortunately the amount of steam this tiny device makes is laughable. Theres also a slight plastic odor emanating from the unit that to me defeats its health purposes. Im going back to the pot on the stove and will just be extremely careful. I do not recommend this unit at all.",1,2021

1104106,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,I`ve had this for a few years and it works well. It will build up pink mold if you don`t clean and disinfect it weekly. That process is a pain but using a toothbrush to get to some of the crevices helps. I`d also recommend the cleaning fish and deminerilazation cartridge to keep it clean.,1,2021
1104112,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I have owned several humidifiers in my lifetime and don`t know why I waited so long to purchase this one. The price is possibly the reason but so glad I took the chance as the vapo cup is a great feature although it doesn`t seem to emit the vapo smell very far from the machine it does use the vapo pads as well. It doesn`t leave everything around it wet even on high which is the best feature.,1,2021

1104214,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"First of all, I was disappointed the sleep mode has a BRIGHT light that doesnt turn off. This makes this humidifier a pain because I have to try and cover the light with an open book or something- anything. Its not easy to cover since its next to the humidified air output. This light that doesnt turn off is not the one that you can selectively turn off and on, that points at the ceiling, its just on when in sleep mode. Nothing like a bright blue to keep you and your toddler awake...The second issue I have with this humidifier is the amount of cleaning I have to do to keep the filter clean. Next time, Im going with a filterless humidifier. Weve seen yellowing and mold, bought a second filter, in the two months weve owned this product. Its just more work than necessary to run. Id return it and get something else. Otherwise, sleep mode is quieter than the normal setting. And my kid liked the light in the ceiling.",1,2021

1104250,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"This product works perfectly for targeting steam for your nose and mouth. Ive read many of the bad reviews and simply shake my head and wonder how some people actually get dressed in the morning. First, one complaint that I saw regularly was the fact that the steam was too hot. The laws of physics does not cease to exist with steam. Water boils at 212 degrees and at 213 turns to steam so yes, steam is inexplicably hot? Secondly read the directions, it says do not put your face on the mask as it is flexible. Very simple solution, position your face slightly above the mask and breath in the targeted steam (targeted being key word.). Btw, by keeping your face above the mask, if the steam feels to hot simply move away a little farther from the mask because, the steam is targeted. Im not sure of the durability yet but as far as the product, ease of use and results I would highly recommend, that is of course if you have common sense and can read and follow very simple directions!",1,2021

We plugged it in to see how much light it would give off, to determine if we wanted to return it for one with the switch, and the projected image was only about a foot in diameter.

Wish I could return the damn thing. Waste of money,1,2021
1104411,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,The curved top means that when filling in sink you must hold the tank as it will not stay flat on sink bottom.Cleaning mineral buildup is a chore. The sump for the carry handle when inverted in the cradle continually fills with water due to leaky gasket after just one year. I put up with it for 2 winters but it is in the trash now.Note: If toppled the steam and water are scalding hot. Burned skin results.,1,2021

The noise level is terrible - &quot;whisper quiet operation won`t disturb your sleep&quot; is a lie. It`s kept me from sleeping soundly the past 2 nights that I`ve tried it because of how loud the steam is. It sounds like one of those old radiators that hiss and shriek. I`m a light sleeper and it wakes me up every few hours. The &quot;nightlight&quot; feature of the glowing dial doesn`t help my sleep either, because there`s no way to turn that off and it adds a glow that I have to turn away from while trying to sleep. Plus, I don`t think it`s actually humidifying my bedroom sufficiently, based on the fact that I`m still waking up congested and dry the past 2 mornings (it`s not a large room, and I have the vaporizer set up a short distance from my bed, so I should be able to feel it). AND on top of all that, the tank has such a small capacity that I have to refill it every night. I knew that from the description before I bought it, and if everything else were working fine I could live with it, but as it is it`s just another frustration. Not meeting my needs at all.",1,2021

I tried putting Vaposteam in the little cup designated for it but it didn`t really make any difference. I walked by it once and smelled an ordor like electical wires burning. I won`t use it again and certainly would not buy it again. I ended up buying a regular vaporizer from Walmart that works much better.,1,2021

Until you have to clean them every week (or use distilled water) and then replace them when they only last a season (or less.) This isn`t as high tech, but it works and has a much lower maintenance profile. Fill it up with water, and maybe a pinch of salt. Done. No filters, no hard water scale to deal with. I haven`t had to clean it yet after 4 months of use.It does make these small gray clumps somehow, and they`re left in the remaining water.

1104647,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"I first bought a Vick humidifier back in college and it lasted about 7 years believe it or not. I had the most basic one where you could add the liquid vicks or use the vicks pads that is now selling for $14.99. I always wanted to invest in the nicer ones bc the previous one I had was hard to clean and can develop particles around the filter (naturally from the water/moisture). This one is nice and creates steam as soon as its powered which is a new plus. BUT like mentioned in other reviews it is noisy and can be creepy. It`s merely just moving the water around but the sound can catch you off guard. Lastly it is still difficult to clean as cleanup can be messy! No matter how you remove the part that holds the water, water will find its was out. This is the best humidifier they have but I do hope they can make improvements while keeping prices down as this was a bit pricy for what it is.",1,2021

1104829,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"We buy one of these every year, as the carbon rods that do the actual heating do wear out in the salty water after a while, even if any other material would degrade even faster. One unit or the next then runs roughly 24/7 from late September to mid-May to try to keep enough moisture in the air to prevent nosebleeds with the wood stove sucking it up, though the mild fall weather this year let the previous one last a little longer than average, while more expensive models get crushed by that duty cycle. This has been the routine since 2008, I can`t really give a stronger recommendation. It`s simple, it`s cheap, it lasts, and it works - like a hammer. Adding more bells and whistles is frivolous.",1,2021

I absolutely love this product. This will be the second one that I have owned. The cap for the water container broke. The only complaint I have is the cost to replace that part was $12 and shipping was $9.99. I figured it was cheaper to go and buy a new one and use my old one as replacement parts.

1105448,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Quit working the first few times. Device faults to refill notification as soon as heating element warms up. Possibly bad seal between element and electronics in base. Very troubling for a name brand device to quit working after only a few hours. Never buy this brand again. Quite certain of that. Note that reviewer Jessica F. states she is on her 5th new england winter with this model yet lives in Florida... New and even cheap items should last more than a few days regardless of state wherein they are operated.,1,2021
1105449,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,Keep in mind this will definitely need cleaned every few days.My first time cleaning I had had the thing for maybe a month and it was making a weird noise.

The heater part actually had about a inch thick calcium crust I had to break off. Noise went away and Im making sure to clean every few days .,1,2021

Any humidifier of this type requires routine cleaning to remove mineral deposits left when the water evaporates. Cleaning interval depends on the mineral content of your water and use of high or low setting. Expect to clean it every few days or weekly as a minimum. Sanitization may be needed also.,1,2021

I liked that it held enough water that I didn`t have to fill it every day. The noise level was lower than the Holmes unit. Cleaning is always annoying with this type of humidifier. There are corners that allow build-up which are impossible to get truly clean, even with regular vinegar soaking (recommended in the manual).

It works for a minute or so and the turns off and the red light comes on. Despite following the reset instructions several times the problem kept happening. Especially disappointing as my husband just wanted some relief from a bad sinus infection and instead of being able to relax we were just incredibly frustrated by this brand new humidifier not working at all. DONT TAKE A CHANCE ON THIS - the manufacturer should discontinue or fix the problem. Clearly this is happening to a lot of people.,1,2021

Neither my husband nor I have been able to ascertain a pattern. It`s irritating to fill the humidifier at night and still wake up to a parched nose & throat in the morning, because it stopped working 20 minutes in.Note about my &quot;easy to use&quot; rating: It works like any humidifier...you refill and clean it once in a while.

Maybe a teaspoon, but it could vary depending on your water, and how much output you want. I like a lot of output so maybe I use more salt than you need. I keep a pitcher full of water next to it so I can refill on extra cold/dry nights where I need it on the whole time. It will easily go through 2 gallons in a night if you want it too. The steam output is incredible. If you prefer not to have to refill it, just use less salt for lower output. Also, I only need to add salt if I empty and rinse the container, otherwise only the water evaporates and the salt I originally put in stays.

1105837,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Unit was easy to use and very versatile. Lasted the entire night without a problem.,1,2021
1105839,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I love this humidifier. Easy to use. Quiet and hopefully energy efficient.,1,2021
1105840,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"It helped me tremendously throughout the night. However, cleaning is needed frequently and for me, the heating element is the hardest part to clean. Be careful when removing tank to refill. Water will drip. Overall this product was a life saver for my sinuses.",1,2021
1105849,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Love it...no filters to replace...BUY IT,1,2021
1105850,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"It is as it was described noiseless, easy to use ( no filter) and easy to clean. A lot of steam. Im using filtered water instead of tap water to prolong the products life.",1,2021
1105856,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,So I have gotten the older model of these and it broke twiceI hoping that seen as this is the newest product that it will work betterPlus I got a protection plan on thisI would say everyone should get thatHumidifier are definitely worth it especially now that it is cold. With the dry air from the heatIt also helps me to be able to breathe better,1,2021
1105865,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Love the smell of these.,1,2021
1105866,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,Vicks - a long standing company that continues to output great products.,1,2021
1105883,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"This is one of the nicer humidifiers I have used, and I have tried a lot of them. It has most of the features I look for: - No filter - Size is compact - Water tank is large enough to last 24 hours before needing a refill - It is incredibly easy to fill. It has a flat top which sits nicely in the sink and a huge opening which makes filling easy. It also makes cleaning easy. - It`s quiet, which is nice if you are running it in a bedroom.The only thing missing is the ability to switch to a warm mist. However, the warm mist humidifiers that I have owned have all burned out after a year or two; the cool mist ones last longer. So it`s not a total negative that it`s missing.I`ve been using this for a few weeks now, and I`m happy with the way it is performing.",1,2021
1105884,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,This product is not worth it. It only steams when salt is added to water and the water spits out from the steam area. I ordered two and they both did the same thing. No good.,1,2021
1105885,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,It stops steaming when it gets to half full so it wastes half a gallon of distilled water. It took a lot of salt added to even get it to start steaming. Bought a more expensive warm mist humidifier that works fabulous!,1,2021
1105886,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Works great! Cleared my mucus quickly! I do wish it was hand held but its OK, great buy!",1,2021
1105889,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I was very impressed how well they worked!! They`re well worth the money and they bring back childhood memories without the Vicks on the chest!!! LOL!!,1,2021
1105922,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Very good value for money,1,2021
1105923,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,I wouldn`t recommend this simply because the refill process is messy and cumbersome. I bought 2 types of humidifiers for my house and this one is just a mess.,1,2021
1105924,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I am a hot sleeper so I love having this thing close by. Very easy to use. Does spill a little when refilling. You can add in scent pads which I really like. My only negative is that the light that comes on is kind of bright for someone who likes a dark room to sleep.,1,2021
1105936,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"I am not super pleased with this product. It has a fair amount of mist that is released which is a positive; however, it has a constant gurgling noise that is louder than others I have had. The noise makes it difficult to sleep at night.",1,2021
1105937,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,I started to wake up to a cough each day and was wondering what was going on and come to find out the filter which was less then 30 days old was already growing MOLD on it! Need I say more? Return or throw away...,1,2021
1105946,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,Hard to smell little to no scent.,1,2021
1105950,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,If you are close to the humidifier you can smell it but if its on the other side of the room you cant I had to move my humidifier next to my bed wish it was stronger smelling.,1,2021
1105952,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,Works as it should,1,2021
1105979,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,Worked ok for about 6 months. Then started making weird noises and only worked on the highest setting. Cleaned it every other week and had a filter fish in it as well and it still smelled and junk in it.,1,2021
1105984,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"Not sure if this humidifier is worth it based on the amount of white residue it leaves on everything around it. And that was after just cleaning and disinfecting it. I havent seen any other reviewers really mention this yet but Ive only had it 2 weeks and its excessive. There is apparently an accessory you can get for it that reduces the amount of white dust it puts out but I havent found it yet, not in store. Going to try to purchase online and see if it helps. Otherwise, very easy to use and clean in my opinion. People say its noisy but I personally think its pretty quiet. I do enjoy some background sound so the occasional gurgles and drips dont bother me. I agree with another reviewer that I dislike that the green light (they call a night light...) stays on even when water has run out and it shuts off. It does last all night and then some though, even running on the highest output setting. Also, I purchased the lavender Vicks vapo pads and they havent seemed to do anything...doesnt really smell like lavender in the room. So it appears theyre just a waste and dry out overnight instead of vaporizing in the water like theyre meant to.",1,2021
1105992,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"This humidifier is nice enough but it gets moldy soooo quickly and is extremely difficult to clean. My husband and I ended up avoiding using it because it was such a pain to clean. The noise never bothered either of us but I could see how it could be annoying. Its also weird to fill, it can be difficult to flip it over and get it back on the right spot of the base. If it was easier to clean, I would definitely have kept it instead of throwing it out (but we did have it for about three years).",1,2021
1105994,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,doesn`t mist just blows out cool air,1,2021

1106014,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,Very disappointed. I have had this for under a year and there is mold and build up all over it. I wouldnt recommend this. We are even strict on cleaning it and it still builds up.,1,2021
1106015,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"This humidifier works well, BUT it is a moldy mess. I set it up in my babys room and after running for one night it had pink scum growing in multiple places. Her room is pretty large so its not like were running the humidifier in a small space. Additionally, this unit is incredibly hard to clean. It barely comes apart so it is difficult to get into all the crevices to clean the pink scum. As a working mom I do NOT have time to deep clean the humidifier every day. I take it apart and let it drain/drip dry over the sink and it still gets scummy. I regret this purchase.",1,2021
1106029,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Great humidifier, very easy to set up and start using, works well and it`s pretty quiet. It has definitely helped me breath better through the night. This humidifier is a warm mist device (as opposed to the ultrasonic cool mist). I prefer this type for winter. It has only 2 settings, low or high, which is actually enough. The vapor/steam comes out through a &quot;chimney&quot;, which is fixed, so you need to turn the whole unit in order to redirect the vapor. It has the option to use vapopads. I haven`t tried them yet. With a full tank of water, you can run it on low for about 18 hours before needing to refill (about 2 nights). Operation is fairly quiet, makes a soft rain-type sound that`s actually soothing to sleep. The big &quot;BUT&quot; is... I bought this for the &quot;filterless&quot; feature. As I read the instructions I realized this unit needs to be cleaned/descaled and disinfected every week; the process is done soaking/cleaning some of the parts in vinegar first and then with a bleach solution. According to the instructions it should take about 50 min, but I found that I took me easily over an hour to wipe, soak, scrub and rinse all the pieces. As I said, first with vinegar and then with the bleach solution. The booklet mentions the option to purchase a filter for it too, so if you don`t have time or don`t want to go through the trouble and spending an hour or so every week cleaning the humidifier, you might want to buy the filter from the beginning. Note: failure to clean the unit as often as directed will cause the heating element to get badly &quot;encrusted&quot;, which will make next cleaning harder and longer (believe me, I missed a week and I regretted it!). Of course if your tap water is &quot;harder&quot; there will be more calcium deposits and viceversa. Another option is to use distilled water. I feel like the extra expense of the filter or distilled water kind of defeats the purpose of the &quot;filterless&quot; feature, but I guess there`s always a catch. Aside from the trouble of cleaning, it`s a great purchase!",1,2021
1106030,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,The demineralization cartridge worked well but is quite expensive for the # of times you can use it as recommended by the seller,1,2021

1106055,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"Don`t buy this humidifier. It will leak in the long run. when I first time used it was not leaking but after you use it the second year, it leaked. Not good at all, It ruined my laminated bedroom floor.",1,2021
1106056,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,It loosened up my congestion. I bought one for myself and one for my dad who was sent home after getting a chest X-ray for concerns of Covid. He is caring for himself at home with this device. Im pleased to know this works. Thank you for relief.,1,2021

1111110,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Its great and I use for everyone in our house. I place it in our leaving room and it goes through out the room. I love how you can use pads or liquid vicks for it. I even gave my to a friend for her baby and went and bought another. Love the price not expensive in my budget and works amazing.,2,2021

We actually sleep better and its relaxing.its easy to clean. We fill it up around 10:30 pm and when we wake up the next day we still have some water left. Be careful not to drop it when its full. I highly recommend it for anyone who suffers from sinus problems.,2,2021

A sludgy, gray mineral deposit layer had built up on the central heating core (see picture) so I cleaned it with vinegar & water as recommended. But I found that each time I ran it at night, by the next morning it would smell and mineral deposits kept building up on the heating unit. In the picture, you can see a faint trace of the mineral deposits from the last time I cleaned it. If I didn`t clean it the smell was really bad, but I had to clean it each time I used it so I gave up. Too late to return & would not recommend.",2,2021

1111270,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"It appeared that there was a good mix of ratings, and thought the product shouldnt be too bad.However, after having it for only a few minutes Ive realized just how loud this machine is, its not extremely loud by any means but for me its enough to annoy me (especially if its on the second setting). There is a sort of consistent sputtering noise as the water is heated up and travels into the basin from the water tank. I had the humidifier placed in my bedroom and the noise annoyed me enough to where I just turned it off. It definitely isnt whisper quiet.I havent cleaned the device but the instructions are pretty straight forward and the parts come apart nicely, most of the parts of the machine are dishwasher safe so that helps a lot.The machine is also pretty intuitive to use, just fill it with water and go!Overall its an okay product considering I got it half off, but for full price it wouldn`t be worth it for me personally.

It is a bit difficult to clean since there are a few small crevices to get into, but i love that there is no filter needed. My only big complaint is that there is now a loud fan/grinding noise whenever it is turned on, which started randomly after about 2 months of use. Since this goes in my daughters nursery, we can no longer use it because its way too loud. Now we are outside of the return window on Amazon, so i guess we will have to find a different brand to purchase.",2,2021

1111301,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Ive used these for years in the tanks of my Honeywell warm mist humidifiers. I do believe they have helped offset well water hardness issues.

But this $15 one can be replaced every year if needed. I put mine away during the summers. It`s upsetting when an expensive one had some drops of water left someplace in it and started to grow some bacteria in there. I can just throw out the $15 one and replace it and not worry about that.The only thing to remember with this one is to put a pinch of salt in it to make it work. This is a great backup to have. Or a great one to have period.",2,2021

1111392,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Its extremely loud and annoying when its on the high setting . Much like a pot of boiling water .

There is literally no reason for it in almost any conceivable form factor.I would describe this product as a complete dud, but I`m giving it some points for actually increasing the humidity in my room.

1111460,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"I wish I would have done more research, but this being my first humidifier I really didn`t know what to look for. My biggest complaint is that it is really hard to keep clean. I boil water and let it cool because I read that would help the mineral build up, but I clean mine after every use and the build up is bad and just keeps getting worse. There`s really no good way to clean it either, since you can`t submerge that part in water. I`ve tried putting some vinegar and letting it soak but the crusty junk stays. You also can`t really clean the water tank either or get all the water out because the hole is too small.The cleaning is the #1 reason why I gave it a lower rating. As far as noise, it`s not bad, and filled up all the way and on low, this thing will last for 12 hours easily.I bought this for my horrible sinuses that make it hard for me to breath at night being all stuffy and 3 weeks of straight use I have not noticed any difference.",2,2021

This has not just happened to me as to others I know and to someone who asked a question on Amazon. It looks to not impact everyone but beware as I have never been allergic or had any reaction at all like I had with this product. I cleaned out my humidifiers before using the fish and it was bad. Almost felt like there was smoke but my air filters didnt detect it nor you cant see it. BUT - the water actually turns a funny color and stains the top and sides of my humidifiers whereas the similar blue sticks do nothing of the sort so I know there is some chemical being put into the water. You will also see it if you have a white humidifier which is an ugly brown color. I wish I would have know this prior as it took me weeks to get back to normal. As soon as I stopped using these, thoroughly cleaned my unit, and filled with fresh distilled water I started getting back to normal.

1111730,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I absolutely love and appreciate the relief my son gets from this Vicks Warm Steam Vaporizer. My son suffers from allergies and asthma so the warm steam helps temporarily relieve his cough and congestion. He breathes more clearly and it helps him sleep through the night soundly without coughing much or being congested. The tank is wide so it makes it easy to fill with water and it doesn`t make a mess at all! The room we use this for is my son`s small bedroom which is perfect for the size of this vaporizer. We could put it in a bigger room and get the same effect which I think is great! This product truly works for my son and I am so thankful that such a product exists.,2,2021

1111879,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Puts out plenty of warm humid air. We live in Maine. Our bedroom is 50 to 60 with dry air. The Vicks humidifier alters that noticeably with slight warmth and plenty humidity, with controls for less. The heater builds up mineral deposits which we wash out almost daily with a weekly vinegar sponge bath. The deposits left a stain on the heater, which is inside the unit and not seen except when cleaning or filling. Have not bought distilled water, would likely avoid the problem. Did try water filtered through a chloramine/metals filter, also left deposits.Problem with allowing deposits to build up is the thickening material will insulate the heater from water contact which will increase electricity usage with less output until unit doesnt work. Dont buy this if not willing to clean it or feed it unmineralized water, seriously.

I used it for about a month until my foot got caught in the cord and it toppled over, cracking the tank, so I had to toss the tank. My fault.

1112105,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I bought two of these. I like the warm air steam myself vs the cool mist. I still use both cool and warm mist.

Make sure you clean the plastic tank every couple of days as it will have little black particals on the bottom. Its from the heat element that you cant see .

1112267,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Hi guys,I hope you are all doing well, and I hope you find this message well.I will say that this is one of the best humidifiers that I have ever used. I have explored multiple types and multiple brands before finding this one.I, personally, do not like the ultrasonic humidifiers. I live in the cold tundra that known as Chiberia (Chicago), and a cool mist humidifier ends up doing more damage to my throat than it helps. I definitely benefit from having a warm mist, steam based humidifier.This Vicks humidifier does an excellent job in terms of providing ample humidity to the room, and it does not take very long. I use the low setting for about 10 hours at night, and I am able to avoid having to refill it every day, because I can refill every 2 days. For those who use the high feature for 10-12 hours, then you will have to refill every night. For the low feature, you should be able to get anywhere between 18-24 hours of use, depending on how close to the brim you fill it.Also, I love how there are no filters, because that can become really pricey really fast.I also have not had any issues with lime scaling, such as in previous humidifiers, and I have only been cleaning it once a month - not once every week. Also, I do not understand the reviews where people says it takes an hour a week to clean it. I am an OCD neat freak, but if you are spending an hour to clean out a humidifier, you really need to reevaluate your life priorities (you are not actually watching it dry all day - that`s like saying doing laundry takes 2 hours lol).Another big thing is, is this one has no leakage issues and it has nice handles on both sides of the portable unit to allow for easy refilling.It does make a small amount of noise, and it does have a small greenlight on it, so if that will bother you then do not buy this. Personally, the small amount of noise helps me to fall asleep, because if blocks out the noise of my other family members running around and being loud. I hardly notice the light.I hope this helps, and I will update this review if anything changes.(FYI, I bought a second one for another family member and they love it)!The price for this does fall down to $ 20 at times, if you think it may be a little pricey, but I ended up paying $33 for the second one, because in a time of a polar vortex, I really do not care.",2,2021

I use it for one room (bedroom) and I haven`t experienced a lot of nose bleeds so it seems to be doing the trick. It said it had a nightlight but the only light on it is the light that says it`s on which can still be bright in a dark room.

We have purchased the cartridge, learned how to clean both the humidifier and cartridge; so we are happy with it. Both my spouse and I sleep much better with this addition to our bedroom. Something I do not recall reading in any reviews was a problem we had. Soon after purchase we noticed our gas range putting out an orange flame. Called our gas company, they arrived and could not locate a problem. After much research we discovered that the humidifier is ultrasonic and that would change the gas from blue to orange.

I bought the SAME exact product from my local pharmacy; and I gotta say this thing is a Godsend. I purchases on Amazon often so I just wanted to see what they had to offer. I was surprised at all the negative reviews and I wanted to address a few. @g3heavenlyfruit, Lou Zumek and Teresita Cruz, not enough steam?? Half the negative reviews are about it burning your hands and face! No, this is not suitable for young children; Ill give you that. There are vent holes PEOPLE so that the steam and your breath can escape. Blaming the steam inhaler for YOU(Nguyen Ngtam, GringoBob, Babsbuys) tipping it and burning yourself is like blaming a gun for shooting someone...we wont go there. Im fighting a respiratory infection(that will remain nameless) and Ive been THANKING GOD FOR THIS THING EVERY DAY! I had two humidifiers that were damaged when I needed them the most so I had a friend pick up this little guy at CVS. I think I paid $40 for it, but Id pay $400 after seeing the undeniable benefits! When youre rocking a 94% on the pulse oximeter and a 15 minute session brings you back to 98%, Id say it was well worth the money, dont you? Or you could go to the hospital and pay thousands of dollars to be on a ventilator. Your choice. Ive got it set up as shown by my bed so I can access it quickly, easily and comfortably.

It started out questionably, with the salt which it states on the packaging and user manual that it only needs `a pinch` once or twice and then never again... I needed to put salt in the water every time or it wouldn`t make steam. Every single time. The water bowl is deeper than the electric steamer thing can reach, so it will be on but not steaming, with a third of the bowl full of water that won`t be used up ever. It doesn`t last the whole night, so my baby would wake up every night around 2am crying and stuffy from breathing the dry winter air.

Thickness is pertinent only as far as the amount/length of time the pad was emitting the volatile oil aroma & it did not last quite 8 hours in the vaporizer compartment. As for value for money, these were purchased with a last-ditch-effort-to-retain-customer insurance OTC card from my last years insurance company, so I guess thats a good thing.

1113006,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"My house has a dining room, a bed room, a living room, a kitchen and a bathroom.

I also have an ultrasonic humidifier, but it spews a lot of white dust into the room, so I dont use it anymore.After using the humidifier for a while, calcium in the water will deposit on the heating element. This deposit is a heat insulator preventing heat transfers to the water and must be removed.I make use of two facts to remove the calcium: toilet paper clings to an object when wet and chemical reaction accelerates when heat is applied. It is well known that vinegar for cooking (5% acidity ) can dissolve calcium although very very slowly. However, the odd shape tub where the element sits make it difficult to immerse it in a bath of vinegar overnight.I wrap several layers of toilet paper on the heating element, pour some vinegar over it, squeeze the paper tightly onto the element and its base (1st picture), turn on low heat long enough till the vinegar vaporizes, then put a plastic cup over it to prevent the vinegar from drying (picture 2). When it cools down, I heat it up again. After several times, I remove the paper and use a wooden stick to scrape off the think calcium layer near the base and use a toothbrush to brush off the thin calcium layer on the top. I then put back the toilet paper still soaked with vinegar on the element and repeat the the heating procedure. After two treatments, the element is very clean (picture 3).

This humidifier, on the other hand adds just the right amount of moisture. Use it all the time, not just when one is sick and it will help the sinuses/lungs/lips,/skin from drying out to begin with which can help one from becoming sick and uncomfortable.Very easy to take apart and clean. As with any appliance that boils water, if one`s water is hard there will be a silica buildup on the heating element that should be cleaned every so often to speed the steaming process. Easy to reach this element. Due to where the opening is located (middle of base), it`s hard to dump out any remaining water in holding tank. Best if it is &quot;used&quot; completely. Auto shut off.

Then there`s the issue of the gross filter. I used the filter that came with it for a week and it turned yellow and looked gross. The same thing happened to all of the other filters I have used.

The two together can be distracting while trying to sleep. The `night light` is always on and cannot be turned off. In a dark room, this is brighter than expected.

1113315,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,"The whole &quot;add salt&quot; thing is annoying. Especially if you want to use this in your bedroom (where I don`t keep salt). The thing doesn`t even last all night. By the time I wake up it either &quot;shuts off&quot; or is &quot;on&quot; but is releasing very little humidity. I put &quot;shut off&quot; in quotations because the packaging claims that it has automatic shut off after it runs out of water, but that`s not really true. The only way to actually turn off the humidifier is by unplugging it (I used a smart plug so I didn`t have to bother). It &quot;shuts off&quot; in the sense that it stops releasing humidity, although it is still very much on. There`s usually still half of the water remaining in the tank when it gets to this point of no longer releasing humidity, despite the fact that it is plugged in and &quot;on.&quot; I`m not sure how many hours it lasts releasing actual, sufficient humidity, but it`s definitely only like 3 or 4 hours max. It can barely increase the humidity in one spot talk less increasing the entire humidity of a standard-sized bedroom. I have the larger Vick`s warm humidifier and that one works really well so I ignorantly went with this because it was the same brand. I would not recommend at all.

1113578,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"I have used Vicks warm-mist humidifiers for years. The Model 750 worked well to humidify an area, I recommended to friends to use for cats with upper respiratory infections--helped clear congestion. It was easy to use--easy to fill the water container, big enough that you could get 2 days on low before refilling. Easy to take apart & clean. Very stable on its rubber-clad feet. The Model 745, which I am reviewing here simply does not cut it. It has an attractive design, but some of that works against it. It is not easy to fill -- the fill hole is small & the tank design works against itself: it does not sit level as you fill it, so it needs to be held in position & do be careful as water can spill as you move & rest it to put cap on. The flare to send mist into the air sends it straight up---not out & up for good coverage. Getting it apart to clean is not easy--the directions are not detailed.-- It took me forever to figure out how to get the heating unit off to clean & I am familiar with the Model 750--this is different, but not that different. The feet are not rubber-clad so it moves if you are not careful.I really like the Vicks Model 750 warm-mist humidifier. When I bought the Model 745 I thought it was the same -- just a more attractive design. Not so. I returned the 745 and bought another 750. Form & function need to work together",2,2021

You have to refill it after less than a day if you use it on high, and there`s no auto shutoff when the tank empties out. There`s no good way of telling how much water is left by looking at it either, you have to take it out and flip it upside down to really tell how much longer you`ve got. Refilling it is obnoxious too, the port is on the undersides and there`s a weird stem that makes it all more difficult to fit under a faucet.

But, the next night when I refilled it again the same thing happened; so I added another pinch of salt and it worked. In the instruction manual it says not to use salt all the time.

This third model has a new design for the white bottom plastic piece of the tank. It looks like they tried to make it easier to clean, but somehow they also made it incredibly noisy! All you hear is constant splashing and dripping. We bought this third one to replace our first, which overheated and stopped working.

So in 2020, I made the mistake of purchasing an ultrasonic humidifier from Costco and while I loved the amount of humidity it put out, I simple couldn`t live with the `white dust` it left on every single surface. I don`t care what they say about it being `safe to inhale`, it you can scrape it off a surface, it can`t good for your lungs. That said...and 25% humidity in our bedroom...is what brought me back to Amazon for another Vicks Warm Mist Humidifier...or so I thought. This is unlike the ones I purchased in the past. While it looks the same, the strong plastic smell permeated the room so heavily it had to be turned off and the room aired out before we could sleep. It will be returned on Monday. I`d rather dry up than wait for the awful smell to dissipate. What a shame.",2,2021

1113900,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I tried both cold and warm mist humidifiers from Vicks. The warm mist humidifier seems to work better in creating moisture.

If you fill the tank it will last overnight which is great to have in your bedroom while you sleep.CONS: it is a little noisy especially on the higher setting. It is a pain to clean. You have to descale and sanitize, but youll have to do that with any humidifier.So after researching for a quality affordable humidifier I found this one.

I wish you had a option to cut the light off. But the company has to figure out a better way to for us to clean it because like I said that black stuff is hard to get out.

The hole on the bottom to fill it with water Is huge and icon fit my hand in to clean the whole inside and I love that! The only thing I`d change is a tiny bit bigger wouldn`t kill I run it from 8 pm to 7 am and if it`s on full blast it`s out of water by the morning b4 7 but a plus to that negative is there is a automatic shut off when it`s out of water. I highly recommend this product and even bought the next one up for a liittle bigger/Med room.,2,2021

1114311,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"I bought 3 of these at $50/ea as we wanted one for each floor of our house to help with the dry winter and static. First of all they never (from the get go) produced any tangible amount of mist nor did they make any noticeable difference in our humidity level. They basically just blow cool air out. They ran straight for 4 days with small breaks until they basically stopped working altogether. Two stopped consuming water, and the third one is barely doing anything at all. The filters are trash and wont last more than a few weeks if the humidifier itself could even outlast the filter! The filters get rock hard, need daily rotation, and additional manual saturation to avoid becoming so brittle that they fall apart (and this is just in 4 days!!!). Honestly this is the worst piece of junk I have ever purchased and sadly it was one of the most expensive options they had (high cost doesnt always mean better apparently).

1114347,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"Tank dripped upon removal for refill. So mopped up. But why so complex? Just fill it up via the top inlet and go! But no! Complex is not always good, donch`a know. Will try again tomorrow after the Chinese New Year when bad luck can be left behind. One may hope... OK. Update: to refill, tank must be lifted - carefully - off the base which is full of water, taken to a sink, turned over, have the bottom leak-proof portal removed, have water poured through the portal, have the portal re-tightened (careful here), have the tank returned to and reset upon the base (careful here) just right as the plumbing must align perfectly. Kinda like a Waterpik where a top tank feeds the pump under it. The rubber seal must not fail. And did not. Yet. But lifting the tank off the base and carrying it away inevitably drips water on the floor. Oops: Mop up on Aisle Four. Plus only 1 scent pad in my shipment as there were supposed to be 2 so I judge this is a return but sold as new. Boo! Plus says &quot;Do Not Run Dry.&quot; I get that. Any pump, same. But no auto cutoff. So requires daily tank level inspection. Plus no humidistat so one can only guess at the proper setting and use. Sorry I bought this.",2,2021

Its been doing a good job keeping the water clean so far and its been in the tank for over a month now. No scunge or weird pond scum that we have gotten in the past with a previous humidifier (same make and model). I guess its doing its job!,2,2021

I fill it up with cold tap water right below the max line, put a little vaposteam in the cup section, add 1 vapopad and let it go all night.

Since then I have gotten sick again & I dont sense any relief for my congestion either.

Petting my dog doesnt shock me and NO MORE WAKING UP with Bloody clots coming out of my nose! I love it!!!! Its not silent but its not bad either. Sounds like a Small Fish Tank running. The dripping sound is peaceful. Just wish you could add essential oils to some kind of bowl around the top . Sucks that you cant.,2,2021
1114475,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Vapor pads 12 pads for less than$7. are a great value.,2,2021
1114483,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Works as it should. RTFM and leaks will be avoided. It has a night light you can turn off. The ring around each knob stays lit when powered so you can find it in the dark. Sleep mode is whisper quiet.,2,2021

1114540,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,The review asks me to rate warmth and thickness - totally not related to this product. But I do change the filter every month in my 1 gal humidifier and find it pretty much eliminates pink slime. I use the humidifier every day in the winter because gas heat dries out my bedroom. But I do clean it with Clorox wipes and rinse really well to make sure it`s clean.,2,2021
1114541,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Love this. Helps keep the air from my humidifier clean.,2,2021

1114547,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"My last Vick`s vaporizer failed last week and I instantly ordered this new one. They generally last me 2-3 seasons and then the electrodes rot out. The price is soo low that I do not even give it a thought.I live in New England and have forced hot air heat. So it is very dry, very. I have tried whole house humidification - very concerning the yuck that builds up in the furnace. I have tried wicking humidifiers - fan noise, expensive filter, yucky stuff grows in them. I have tried vaporizers - white dust, terrible white dust at times and I tried using distilled water at a dollar a gallon but that gets expensive. Then there is this very inexpensive solution that is so absurdly perfect. Both steam and heat! It will easily overwhelm an average bedroom with moist warm air in a few hours. I use it in my family room each evening. I add a pinch of baking soda, fill it once and within minutes hot steam which makes a huge difference in a very short time. When the water drops below the electrodes it stops. Next evening repeat. Very inexpensive, no ongoing cost, most effective way to add humidity and a bonus of raising the temp in the room it is in. Fantastic... They do consume electricity which varies depending on the water`s properties - so a low steam uses lesser electricity than upping the steam (baking soda).",2,2021
1114548,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I like the capacity so Im not filling it constantly. It produces warm steam which is nice for the winter time. I wish it had a setting to adjust the output but it doesnt. Sometimes you need to add salt to the water so it steams up. We have a fairly low salt content in our water.,2,2021
1114554,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Good,2,2021

1114631,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I can`t understand why people are saying the vapor pads are fake. I`m 72 years old and was raised on Vicks Vapor Rub so trust me I do know it`s scent.

1114656,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"The amount of visible mist coming out does not feel very impressive. I do enjoy the warm temperature and that this humidifier doesnt have a filter that needs to be replaced every few weeks, but you have to very careful and place the tank to be perfectly aligned to the base. Its very easy to place it incorrectly and if its off at all, it will not work. I also think its annoying how you have to turn it off and wait 15 minutes and allow it to cool off before using it again. The hard plastic is a bit better than cheaper flimsy humidifiers but I felt that this warm mister left much to be desired, but is good enough for the time being.",2,2021

1114908,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,From picture it looks like the best and also from the description it`s best but when it arrived it very small and also it`s not throwing the proper warmth . And also needs to change the water in less than 10 mins plus as written in the description it`s multi purpose but i don`t find it as multipurpose . I am not satisfied with this purchase .,2,2021
1114915,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,It takes two pads to fit in my Air Innovations humidifier MH 505. They work a little for aromatherapy but not great not a good idea of mine. Too expensive for 8hrs of use.,2,2021
1114945,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Very happy with these humidifiers (we have 3 now). While they aren`t the cheapest available, they are quiet, offer great controls, and have the ability to add Vicks pads if needed when someone is sick.

1114948,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,Went for the budget model since I`m staying at my moms house for a few weeks. Instant regret - this machine is noisy and `spits` water out. It has a nice capacity but gurgles too much and distrupts my sleep.,2,2021

1114958,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"I was a little uncertain at first as I have a Vick`s V5100 series and this was the only filter that came up in the Amazon search and it is considerably smaller in size to the original filter. However, it fits perfectly and works just like the original filter had done. I normally don`t change these out that often in my previous place I lived, but I do now as the water here in town has heavy minerals and this helps to reduce disassembly and cleaning times to remove those residues. Highly recommend for other buyers.",2,2021

1115034,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"This works alright, but one might want to use antibacterial or antifungal or something. Every week you kinda need to run vinegar though it for a while or something like that, or it`ll get all slimy. I don`t think that`s unusual.",2,2021
1115036,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,I have a VICKS VMW845 that I bought locally. I needed to replace our old VICKS V745 and I am satisfied with the newer model. I find that both models perform just about the same and in our situation they just about do the job. Our apartment has very low humidity in the winter. 17% is normal when the temp outside is in the 20s. Either VICKS model will bring our bedroom up to 37% humidity. The newer VICKS VMW845 is much easier to clean which is a big plus. It`s also much easier to refill the water tank.,2,2021
1115037,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I have used this model in the past and bought it again for that reason. I noticed a difference in the air in my bedroom in just one nights use. Its easy to move around and refill. My house plants love it too!,2,2021
1115039,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Followed all the instructions correctly. After 2 uses there is white mold inside the unit even after I had already cleaned it with vinegar. The reservoir is so small its impossible to clean it.,2,2021

1115147,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"The pressure that must be applied on the screw top with a thumb and two fingers to close it and keep it from leaking makes it difficult (painful) to open. It has a nice big aperture but the designers didn`t think this one through. They were probably thinking of the average user. Sigh. The rounded shape also makes the full and heavy reservoir a bit awkward to get onto the base. Next time I`ll look for a cylindrical shape and a screw top that I can grasp with more than three fingers. Otherwise it`s great. It has a very good output, even at lower settings. it`s holding up so far after about 6 weeks of just about constant use.",2,2021

I wanted another for my babys room and I thought of buying something costly. Since then I have tried 6 different humidifier and had to return them all. Most of them were from big brands. Reason I had to return them was- their warm mist was not so warm and they were spitting a lot of white chalk and cleaning was soo painful.I am glad and so happy that I came back to this one and this one works so well that I dont need to worry dryness and white chalk around my baby.Will buy this in future as wellI,2,2021

1115328,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"Worked great before it broke during cleaning. This was a great humidifier, but Ive had it for less than month and it no longer turns on. I cleaned it once a week like the manufacturer recommends but apparently you need to be super careful when cleaning, it stopped turning on after I cleaned it the third time ever. Hopefully its just a defect, but I would highly recommend looking up how to clean this before purchasing, its quite tedious! 20 mins vinegar and 20 mins bleach clean every week, but be extra careful because my humidifier stopped working after cleaning. Had to let it sit for a day before it started working again.",2,2021

1115335,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"I never leave reviews, but I am compelled to do so for this product by the tremendous difference it has made in my life. During pregnancy, I developed a sinus sensitivity to dry environments to such an extent that I would get nosebleeds if I didn`t have a humidifier constantly running all day long. This unfortunately continued well after my baby was born. I still run humidifiers constantly during the winter, but ever since using this product I haven`t had a nosebleed once. I use it multiple times a day, for less than five minutes at a time, and my nose and sinuses feel so much better. You don`t realize how important it is to have a normal moisture level in your nose until pregnancy robs it from you. This thing could not be easier to use: it has one on/off switch, takes a few minutes to warm up, and then it`s a heavenly shot of hot steam right to the dome. It gets too hot to use for more than 5 minutes, but that`s more than enough to change my life. Highly, highly recommend and hope they never stop making it.",2,2021

1115383,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,I wanted to like this humidifier because its cute and put out a good amount of humidity but it makes this awful tinkling noise like a dripping faucet but worse because the water hitting the ultrasonic plate flings up into the air and large droplets fall back down into the rest of the water. Some people might find it soothing but I found it so irritating that I couldnt sleep so I am returning it.,2,2021
1115384,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,This is just what I wanted. It adds moisture to the air and increases humidity in our home. It seems like my husband is coughing less when it is on nearby his chair. I am really glad it does not require a filter. Those were a big hassel. I really like the auto-off feature too.

You wonder why the tank is empty and when you look under it, the water is all over your floor. I wouldnt waste my money on this again, Ive gotten the replacements because I got the 2 extra year warranty. I use to have the exact one but the tank was green. It was 4 years old and I decided to get a new one. Not sure why the green tank lasted much longer compare to the blue tank that lasted few days.

Plugged it in and lights automatically began to flicker and then all power shut off to the room (breaker trip). Got the power back on and moved humidifier to another outlet and there was no steam. Waited 10 mins and added a little salt it began to release steam for about 3-4 hours. Shut everything off and decided to try it again the next night. Again plugged it and humidifier started spitting out water everywhere and was making noise like a steamer. Shut it down... terrible buy!,2,2021

Much better deal. But they do work... less hard water and less cleaning of my humidifier I used almost daily. I moved to Vegas so it`s dry here!,2,2021
1115555,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"This machine puts out a nice steady stream of mist as soon as it`s turned on, but the humidity level in the room never goes more than a couple of % points higher than it would be without it. (When I used my old Vicks steam humidifier, the humidity would go from 38% to mid-50s after running it for several hours.) This is the case even when it`s not that cold out and our furnace isn`t running very often. I don`t understand why the room stays so dry, as the water level in the humidifier goes down steadily, and I`m refilling it at least once a day. The mist goes up about 2 feet, then turns and drops to the floor.It`s very easy to remove & reset the tank; refilling takes about a minute using the tub faucet. It runs silently except for occasional gurgles, when air bubbles up to equalize pressure in the tank. Unfortunately, that sounds just like my cats do when they`re starting to heave, and startles me every time it happens.",2,2021
1115556,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"I bought this to supplement my new(ish) Honewell humidifier with a filter and wanted to try out a non-filtered humidifier for comparison. We have very hard water so I was concerned at first that I would have to thoroughly clean it every day and am finding that is not necessary. I have been cleaning it with a water and vinegar solution weekly with a scrub brush and just a quick rinse each day. Pretty easy to clean the hard water stains off and it isn`t leaving any white residue anywhere else in the house. It does a nice job as it should, generally keeping a 600 sq ft area pretty consistent around 40% humidity set at half blast. One tank of water will easily last the whole day set at half speed like that. The motor sound can be heard, but is not bothersome at all.

1115627,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,We have well water so we need to add a pinch of table salt to it. It puts out the perfect amount of steam and no white film left on everything like the ultrasonic humidifiers.,2,2021

At least half an inch too tall, tank wouldnt sit flush. Customer service used a script response which repeated useless directions. Smashing the filter into place as much as you need to, if you wanted to flip the filter each time you refill the tank as directed, youd go through 5-7 filters a week. There is a sharp metal mesh in the replacement filter that scratched me when I followed the directions to wet and bend the filter into shape.

It produces sufficient hot steam for the 12-15 minutes I use it each time. I find that steam shoots out the sides by the adjustment tabs now and then and, if your griping the tabs, your fingers will feel the hot steam. That`s my reason for four stars rather than five.

1115695,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,There is nothing like the soothing of vicks when you have a cough or cold. I have two vicks warm mist humidifiers for our house. I always stock up on these pads that go in some of the humidifiers (you need to check to make sure your model has the slots for these). Mine has slots for the use of two at once. They last 8 hours per pad and they really make a huge difference. Pair this with vicks vapo steam for your warm mist humidifiers and you will sleep like a baby cough free!,2,2021

1124143,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,it took about an hour for mist to come out and then it did not really warm up the air. The cooling version works much better than the warming mist.,3,2021

1124169,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I got this for my wife while shes pregnant she came down with stuff nose and sore throat and she couldnt take any cough medicine while being pregnant so we tried this with the Med size vicks humidifier for the room right next to her side of the bed and it works perfect so far she can smell again and her voice came back in like a hour,3,2021

1124248,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"The filter itself is bulkier than then normal ones, I had to cut it down. It only stays clean a couple of days.

1124270,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"This works pretty well for keeping the filter from becoming moldy. I use the humidifier during the dry months of the year, not all year long. I have not noticed any side effects after using it like that over one year.I worried about whether it is spewing pesticide-grade silver into the air I breath. So I got the Safety Sheet from Home Depot`s website. The sheet says: &quot;This chemical is not considered hazardous by the 2012 OSHA Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR 1910.1200).&quot;The sheet also says: &quot;Very toxic to aquatic life with long lasting effects. May cause slight eye irritation.&quot; So please don`t dispose of it by flushing down the toilet! Put it in the garbage. It also says &quot;Wash off immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes. &quot; So don`t let the filter water splash into your eyes or on your skin. And obviously don`t let anyone drink the water (it`s toxic).This part in the Handling and Storage section of the Safety Sheet caught my eye:&quot; Do not breathe vapor or mist.&quot;Wait what? Isn`t that exactly what I am doing when I put it in a humidifier? Maybe they mean don`t breath the chemicals in directly. It`s okay if diluted in water? I guess?",3,2021

1124322,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"This humidifier should be an easy choice because of the well known brand name and it did work for me, but only for 3-4 fills. After than, it stopped blowing steady steam and the motor was struggling, i could hear it turning off (not working.. stopping) unless i tapped on it continuously. I had to buy another unit to replace it so maybe i got a lemon but it`s too late to return/exchange. Also i found some small dirt or unidentifiable debris of some kind inside the tank each time i refilled it. Added salt once but it made no difference. You may have a better experience.",3,2021

I would NOT put this in a child`s room. Partial stars because the manufacturer made it right and is sending us a new humidifier for free since they don`t have any tanks in stock. Hopefully this means they`ve realized there`s an issue and are working on better tanks!",3,2021
1124368,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,So for the most part I like this humidifier better than any other and I have been through a few. You must stay on top of cleaning it as mold will start to grow but it`s the one that works for me.,3,2021

They fit (tightly) and they have metal in them. I use filtered water in my humidifier and these filters turn brown and crusty within 15-20 days even flipping them with each fill as directed with humidifier.

When I got into it I found a bunch of brown gunk in the bottom base. Nowhere does it say that part of the machine should be dismantled and cleaned. It says no filter. When I got the bottom off there is a filter but it was gunked up with brown and white glaze. Why doesn`t the instructions say that part has to be taken apart and cleaned periodically????,3,2021

I have chronic bronchitis and am often congested from mucus in the throat more so that sinuses. First off, does it eliminate my congestion. No, of course not.... but it does provide relief and is soothing and relaxing in the process. I also like that I do not need special bottles of water, which I beleive would have increased to likelihood for it to end up on the shelf.

Also, as someone who runs hot, this has helped cool my room down while still helping me breathe during dry winter nights.

If I put salt in the water it did give a little more steam, but lasted even less hours. But, the thing that I was most disappointed in was the color of the water that was left in the reservoir. It was black, dirty water with small specks of black floating in it. My first thought was, how can it be healthy to breath dirty water. So, even though it was brand new, I did a cleaning according to directions. Next night, same thing. I am past my return window otherwise it would be going back.",3,2021

I like how I can use the vapo pads with it too. It is a great product have for those times when stuffy noses and coughs can keep you up at night.

The cool/warm mist humidifiers just arent warm enough, and again I get congested. This was one of the last warm mist humidifiers I could find, and thankfully, it works just fine. Its very quiet, unlike several others Ive had before. You dont need a filter, and the instructions say you can use tap water. I use distilled water, but its nice to know you can fill it from the tap if you happen to run out of distilled water. It runs all night and most of the morning without running dry. It doesnt get as much moisture in the air as the cool mist ones, mostly because our bedroom is pretty large, but Im fine with that. Our bedroom gets up to about 35% at night. We live in a really dry climate, so 35% is fine for us. It would do better in a smaller room, no doubt.",3,2021

It helps with my dry sinuses and eyes here in Phoenix. I like to run it while sleeping, but sometimes all day, too. The water here is very hard and leaves heavy deposits on everything, so I never use tap water, always distilled. I clean it with bleach water, let it sit, use a thin bottle brush to scrub the crevices, and just rinse it until the bleach smell is gone. I am getting green this time, instead of blue, just for something different :)",3,2021
1126301,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,I`ve had this brand 4 eons. But for some reason this year it started growing mold??

During drier/ cold days, I would turn it on at dusk and run it until I went to sleep, so it didn`t run all night (it is quiet, but not silent). It made a positive difference. I like the option to add a scent, but haven`t purchased more of the scent pads yet. They only seem to last a day or two, but a nice extra. I would recommend this unit.",3,2021

The little scent pads are much nicer to use compared to the cup option for adding liquids as the cleanup is easier.I have been using distilled water to avoid any mineral build up.

Blows nice stream of hot steam.BUT, and this is a big BUT, every day there is a pool of nasty-looking black bits and grey bits at the bottom of the remaining water, and they surely seem to come from the vaporizing unit as I tried rinsing it in the sink and a TON of those bits came out. Yechhhh. I assume these are metal or plastic, it is hard to tell, but my far bigger concern is the likelihood that these are also being blown into the air when the steam is on.My next test will be to try running this on a white sheet one night to see if the unit is indeed dispensing the nasty grey/black bits, and if it is (and I am pretty sure it is as the volume of these in the water receptacle evry morning is quite high), straight into the trash it goes!",3,2021

1127128,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"I`ve had one of these for years. I`ve been around several other types during that time, mostly cool mist. Growing up, I had the older style vaporizer and borrowed one similar to that as well recently.Baseline humidity levels are maintained fine with the cool mist , but I prefer this type . It warms up the room in the winter allowing for lower heating bills and less dry heat being pumped in. If you`re sick , it definitely helps a lot more than cool mist and at one point I had it next to my bed. Threw a wash cloth over the steam spot then lifted it to get steam help me breathe better . Keeps washcloth warm if sinus headaches are relieved with warm washcloth.It`s easy to refill. I can`t hear it all standing next to it if I have a fan on and only a little if not. As for the review mentioning mold , that`s not mold. That`s mineral buildup from hard water. Soaking it in bleach won`t work as well for that and if it were mold bleach would kill it fast . You can run it through a cycle outside with vinegar water or pour vinegar water in the element area and let it set . It comes up easier if you do it weekly. I have a kettle that`s cleaned with vinegar water so I just dump that water in there.All in all, I`d recommend this style. It`s affordable and easy.

Heated vapor is healthier and prevents most mold concerns, and hard water causes less problems than in other makers` designs (where the slightest mineral build-up quickly stops the machine), so overall less frequent mineral-deposit cleaning is needed. Vicks` vapor rub pads or liquid can be used for decongestants, or a touch of essential oils for overall pleasant atmosphere and health.",3,2021

It`s perfect for long nights when I have a stuffy nose. The next thing I like about this product is how small it is. The humidifier can easily be fit onto a nightstand. This product is also sure to last a long time as it is made out of heavy-duty durable plastic. Another noteworthy feature about this humidifier is the fact it has a convenient slot for Vicks Vapopads (which are sold separately) .

It makes the noise of the mist and an occasional gurgle. I sleep with a noise machine on and can`t hear it at all over that.I had a cool mist humidifier in the past and it soaked my wall to wall carpet with the mist, which is no good and can lead to mold and mildew. I had to put towels down for it because the mist fell to the ground and soaked the carpet. This warm mist one is great and doesn`t get anything wet. This mist goes up like 7 inches then vanishes/dissipates. It does not fall back down. It does not get anything nearby wet. It`s great. A full water tank will probably last you 11 hours.

1128127,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Humidifiers are so helpful to my family in the winter when we are sick. This is my favorite brand of humidifier because they are durable and work well for a long time. I don`t have to worry about them leaking or breaking because they are made from heavy duty plastic.,3,2021

1128218,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] As a member of Bazaarvoice and TryItSampling I received for free a Vicks Warm Steam Vaporizer to try and give my honest opinion on. This produces steam by boiling water. That kills any germs that may grow in the water. There is a sensor to automatically shut off when the water gets low. It has its own slots to add your vapor pads in so you get that soothing menthol scent as they are warmed by the steam. It will last up to 24 hours without running out of water. This is great for people with allergies.There`s a nightlight on the top as well. Easy to clean up with the divot in the lip it prevents you from pouring all of the water out when you are cleaning the basin and helps to get all the residue out.,3,2021
1128230,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,Menthol smell went away very quickly. Kept waking up to weird smell. Finally figured out it was a smoke smell coming from humidifier. These pads got very warm and smelt smoked (not burnt).,3,2021

Also, it is difficult to line the reservoir up with the base. I finally put a mark on the reservoir and on the base to line them up. Also, it is a little difficult to close the door for the vapor pads, so when I change them, I have to fiddle with it a bit. I use a &quot;cleaning fish&quot; to float in the tank.

1128861,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"I use the eucalyptus/menthol vapor pads with the cool mist vaporizer. The result is a fine mist with a soothing scent that is not overpowering. It is a little difficult to put two pads in the compartment and close it so each time I change the pads, I have to fiddle with closing the compartment. Perhaps the vaporizer unit design could be updated to address this issue. We live in an apartment. Our furnace has a humidifier but the air is still very dry. I don`t know how to adjust the furnace. Therefore, the vaporizer is necessary and the essential oil pads make the vapor mist smell nice and seems to be better than using just the water without the vapor pads.",3,2021

I purchased a second one for my kid`s room and this newer model smells horrible like plastic fumes. I ran it for over 12 hours straight thinking it would go away but it never did. Even after it`s turned off, you can smell the fumes on the plastic. They must have changes something in their plastic manufacturing process and are using something different in their plastic parts because this unit now puts off horrible plastic fumes. Our lungs hurt after 20 minutes of running this and we had to just put away.We can`t return it because we don`t have the box. We`ve contacted VICKS Directly in hopes of resolving this.I can NOT recommend this unit the way it`s being manufactured. Something unhealthy is going on with the plastic it`s made from.

It beats having to use a humidifier and having to clean it every 2 days when you add the Vicks liquid. This is great if you don`t want that hassle of maintaining a humidifier but still get the same relaxed smell in the air with the vicks. Only flaw I wish this had was an off and on switch.

1133521,2021 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"First time using a VICKS warm mist humidifier. TERRIFIC!!! Used it nights in 10 x12 bedroom. Turned it on high only the first minute to get it going, then kept it on low rest of night. Humidified perfectly and warm mist was very comfortable. ( I always had to wear socks to bed with the cool mist ones I used before. ) Hardly made any sound on low, but it does make a fritzing sound on high that may bother light sleepers. I also used the Vicks vapo steam several nights. That was really wonderful, too! - And Easy to use and clean the dispenser. Another major reason I got this was that every part exposed to water could be cleaned and dried so no hidden mold issues. TERRIFIC!!! Very easy to maintain and dry. I worked out a routine that LITERALLY takes JUST 5 MINUTES. I Use a Soft cloth that is not thick and also a manicure stick (for cuticles that you can get from beauty stores like Ulta3 or Sally`s - wood so you don`t scratch the unit) and wrap the cloth around the end of the stick for the hard to reach areas. I also use only distilled water, and as you see by the pictures I just took today, it is worth the small cost of distilled water since I never got any scale or yukky stuff that could lead to bacterial or mold issues. I have used it the entire winter, and am preparing now to store for summer. You can see it`s like new! This VICKS humidifier is the only one I found in all my searching that can be cleaned and dried thoroughly - No hidden mold worries. No chemicals or gadgets needed to add to the tank. There were times I had to skip the cleaning for JUST a day because so rushed for work. But otherwise rinsed and wiped it out faithfully (just 5 min!) and never had to do the vinegar treatment for scale which saved a lot of time.) I did mark the tank with a green sharpie at the level to fill each night with the amount of water needed so no waste. I also Like the green dial light. The very few times it bothered me, I just turned the humidifier, or turned on my side. I hope they never stop making this humidifier. Easy to use and safe from mold with proper maintenance!",4,2021

1133965,2021 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"We`ve been very happy with this humidifier. Just a tip: We don`t live in an area with a particularly high mineral content in the water, yet there`s still a build up at the bottom of the humidifier really quickly. If we don`t clean it every three days (we run in pretty continuously) the grit at the bottom on the element becomes rock hard and impossible to clean. So, you have to stay on top of it and follow the instructions on it exactly. If you do that, cleaning it is a breeze. It`s quiet, it`s simple to use, and it`s MUCH easier to reach in to clean it than with other humidifiers. It`s small, so if you`re in a large room it`s not going to do a lot to actually raise the humidity of the room, but it helps. Check the room size before buying.",4,2021
1133975,2021 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Like many, I suffer from seasonal allergies and this early spring has been one of the worst for pollen. Along with prescription medication, I added this Vicks Sinus Steam Inhaler to my list of tools to combat those allergies. This steam inhaler is easy to set up and you can have it working in about seven minutes from opening the box. It is used with a menthol Vicks pad which comes in a variety of scents. You will have to purchase these pads separately after using the sample included. The steam is more of a mist than a stream, but it soothes the sinus cavity and gives immediate relief. While you can use tap water with this product, I chose to use distilled water to help the lifespan of the product and to avoid any deposit stains. It is simple to clean with a wet paper towel or cloth and its small size is easy to stow in a bathroom cabinet.

1134348,2021 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"I live in the desert, have plants that could use some humidity, and was hoping the moisture would help my allergies too. So, I bought this model humidifier on the recommendation of a friend who has two.The first one I received leaked water out of the seams where the chimney connected to the base as well as the vents on the back, and onto the floor. Tested it three times to be sure. So I asked Amazon to send a replacement. I immediately took the replacement out of the box and was very happy -- for 20 minutes. Despite the water tank being completely full and the spring outlet working perfectly fine, the reset light comes on every 20 minutes because water for some reason isn`t flowing into the oblong-shaped bowl in the base and the humidifier thinks it`s out of water. Sometimes, slightly moving the tank half an inch will get the light to go off but it always inevitably stops misting and the reset light comes on after about 20 minutes.I officially give up on this brand of humidifier. For those brave enough to try, may the odds be ever in your favor!",4,2021

Years ago I had one of these same humidifiers and it lasted on high for over 2 years. I`ve had this one for under a year and the motor has already quit even with regular cleanings using vinegar the company recommended. We read about a warranty and looked into it, but the hoops they were making us jump through made it worth it to simply purchase a new humidifier. I simply can`t fathom what would have killed this humidifier in a year and the company will surely lean towards the idea that user error screwed it up. You will have to pay shipping both ways for them to send your same old humidifier back to you refurbished. It just didn`t seem worth the headache.",4,2021

Since getting my Vicks humidifier and adding the menthol pads and running it every night, I wake up with completely clear sinuses, and my eyes are no longer itchy and watery. I happen to love the smell of menthol on top of that, so the combibation has been a godsend. I definitely recommend them for anyone who has sinus issues or seasonal allergies, or if you have slight asthma like my son. He has one, and he hasn`t been having sneezing fits nearly half as much, and he seems to be breathing much better overall. I couldn`t imagine either one of us going back to the way things were before.",4,2021

1135912,2021 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Does not deposit the mysterious `white powder` most ultrasonic devices do, and, likely due to the warm heat, it raises the humidity levels by around 10% in less than 1/2 hour.",4,2021

1135925,2021 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,I bought this based on the familiarity of the name but am disappointed with the product. It barely produces any steam. It sates to add 2.5 tbsp of water to the reservoir and you need to wait 6 minutes for it to warm. I did follow those instructions but by the time it warms up most of the water is gone and there is barely any steam. Hugh disappointment and I would like to return it.,4,2021
1135930,2021 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"Honestly... not worth $45.You have to wait for the steam to rise, which takes about 6 minutes according to the box. So you have to wait by the thing until its ready, the cord is short so you will be stuck by an outlet.Im in San Antonio, so allergy season is intense. This definitely does not produce enough steam to actually feel a difference.Face covering really doesnt fully fit to your face so steam will leak, and you really cant do anything as your eyes will be covered partially.You can buy something else that actually provides sinus relief for a better price.",4,2021
1135934,2021 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,When I purchased this I thought it was a cool mist but discovered when I got it home it was not.

I have not had issues with it leaking, it disperses oils well, the shutoff when it is empty works well too, helps with allergies and eczema. No complaints yet and would recommend this product. It does have a little bit of a plastic smell at first but that went away after the first hour or less. It glugs when the water goes into the bottom but is otherwise quiet. It takes a few minutes to warm up. The bottom can get pretty hot when running but hasnt damaged anything. It is messy to replace the water but that is easily fixed by putting a towel down when removing the tank.",4,2021

So, need to cover it up with black tape. A bit of light gets out. This is a net negative.2. Instructions make it unclear whether the company have actually cleaned the item. They say 2 put some pieces in the tank while you`re cleaning it. Well, those 2 pieces don`t fit into the tank. So...for an item that is capable of getting mold in it, I consider sketchy cleaning instructions, well...not awesome.3. They make this recommendation for 40-60% humidity level. From what I read from the EPA (who I`m going to trust over Vicks), you shouldn`t let humidity go over 50% or else risk mold. So, this is fixable...just make sure your hygrometer doesn`t go over 50%. That said...sketchy that they say 40-60%.Its overall decent. But I imagine I`ll end up buying a better machine in a few months. We`ll see...",4,2021

No settings, no dials & no buttons. Just plug it in & forget it! It runs for around 24 hrs or more & shuts off automatically. The only thing I don`t know bcuz I don`t have the gauge or tool that measures the amt of moisture in the air (forgot what it`s called). Also there is no moisture or condensation anywhere (walls, floor, etc) so u don`t have to worry about ruining or wiping up anything. And last of all, for the price it`s awesome.

1136509,2021 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"My boyfriend bought me this humidifier during the winter to help with nasal and sinus issues, and I was very excited to use it... but it only worked for about a week before it started POURING water from the sides and bottom. I couldnt find anything wrong with it. The rubber seal looked fine. Nothing was cracked. All I did was take the bottom cap off like I had done every day before, fill it, and put the cap back on. I have tried using it 3 times since, and same result. 5 minutes after I put the tank back on, water ends up everywhere, and I mean everywhere. Half the tank of water was all over my desk, books, and floor. It only caught my attention because I could hear the water pouring onto my carpet. I wanted to love it so bad, I even went and got the pads to put in the side, but never used them because its defective.",4,2021

I love everything about this unit except.... the unit runs for a couple of minutes and shuts off. I have to wait an hour or so to restart and once it restarts, it will run through the cycle. I`m hoping it`s a bogus unit because the company has served me very well in years past. It`s my favorite hands down!!

1140017,2021 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Love this humidifier! Just have to clean it every few weeks to stop some gross build up even with purified water. It sometimes has a large air bubble that needs to escape and makes a noise, but I can sleep through it. I do not use it on a super high setting so I can go a few days before refilling the tank. Plus using the vicks right in the humidifier saved us when we caught a small cold.",5,2021
1140058,2021 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,the fan is loud and there doesn`t seem to be any humidity in the air. I bought it 3hours ago and been using it for an hour and I already don`t like it. it`s for my kids med/small room. don`t get it. I`ll be returning it.,5,2021

1140131,2021 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Hate it. Very high maintenance its like a science experiment to see if it will actually work.

I cannot tell you how wonderful it is to not have to worry about it! I feel like they work quite a bit longer than advertised, but that may depend on water temp, if the water is distilled (this is what we use, as our water is REALLY hard otherwise) vs filtered vs not, etc. Will definitely buy again!Note: In one of my pictures the fish isn`t floating - that`s totally my fault, as it got hit kinda hard and the top part that holds air and makes it float got cracked, but it was a really good picture otherwise, so I included it.

1140200,2021 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"Please read this whole thing because Im telling you this is a waste of money and possibly bad for your health or possibly even a fire hazard. There is possible smoke damage in that tray picture. Pictures of heating element from both machines, tray picture from current newer machine.I bought my first one in 2019 from Amazon. I didnt know you were supposed to clean it every week so after one month the heating element was covered in calcium and other minerals. I cleaned it all off at that time and got the heating element back down to its original grey coating but that started to chip away. From then I made sure to clean it every week, used a Protec Filter in the tank, and only used it on low. Still used tap water because it didnt say otherwise in the instructions. Didnt use it during the summer (2020) and took it our late fall into winter(2020).Well at the start of this year (2021) I had a horrible sinus and chest infection. I noticed more of the heating element had chipped off during a cleaning. I had started to use water from my zero water filer pitcher too this year because that gets rid of all dissolved solids from water. So no calcium or mineral deposits but there was staining on the plastic from the years of use now and I figured it might have been the cause of my sickness. So I contacted Vicks, who sent me over to P&G. They looked at pictures I sent them, heard my story, and even paid to have it shipped to their private lab to have it tested (which concluded nothing). They offered to send me a new one. So I took it because I figured what else am I going to do I must have had a defective one (wish I read the other reviews here first).Took forever for P&G to ship it but I got my new one for free in the mail last month. First week: used my water from the zero water pitcher, no problem (did not have protec filter fish thing). Second week (still no protec fish) a minor bit of calcium build up, which was weird because my water tester said there was no dissolved solids in my water before I put it in. So I decided well to keep it nice I should get distilled water for a cycle, went to target and got a gallon of distilled water which was about a tank and a half (3 nights on low). It looks like there was a small fire in the thing. The stains on the plastic are so much darker than my last machine and the heating element had a coating of dark stuff all over it. My mom and I were shocked and mad. It only lasted a month and got messed up this bad?! Yes it was free but how is it this messed up.Im not sure the thing shuts off once it detects no water. It will have a red light to tell you its low but Im starting to think it doesnt shut off the heating element. So if your tank runs out in the middle of the night because it was only half full than the heat from the element must be burning the plastic. Thats the only thing I can think of that cause this smoke looking build up on it. Im not a smoker and no one I know is a smoker, and even if they were no hell Id let them near my bedroom or humidifier with my bad asthma. It seriously looks like burn plastic. Purified distilled water couldnt have done this.Im going to contact P&G tomorrow to report this but Im so mad about this now I had to alert whoever is reading this to STAY AWAY from this humidifier. The KAZ company thats building these for P&G for Vicks must be using some bad construction and not be honest with P&G or Vicks. Ive never even seen the company KAZ before this.",5,2021

This ensures I have some good experience with what I purchased and can maybe comment on the reliability of the product as well. In this case, it is VERY easy to write a review MUCH sooner.I bought these filters for our new Vicks VEV400 humidifier solely because of the misleading advertising stating &quot;Antimicrobial Treated Filter - Helps prevent the growth and migration of mold&quot;. Mould grew in a previous humidifier years ago so I have been anal-retentive ever since.The so-called `antimicrobial` coating on these ProTec filters is obviously BS because despite rotating and flipping the filter every day (per instructions) and using store-bought, filtered water, we had mould growth in less than a month. This is the first time we have had visible mould in a humidifier in over five years. This humidifier is only a few months old but the original filter that came with it never developed mould.We bought a different brand of filters today and threw out the remaining 2 filters from this ProTec 3-pack that we bought.

Quite operation with minimal hum at night. I clean mine REGULARLY. Ive seen this used in the acoustic room of a guitar store. They NEVER cleaned theirs and it looked like some kind of disgusting science experiment. I suggest you regularly clean the reservoir unless you want the same kind of wretched view.

Haven`t used it since I was a kid though. But I was super congested and thought I`d give it a shot. I could barely smell it now. I don`t think I`d get it again. Didn`t seem to help too much.

Its also important to note the price is usually much more expensive than this particular item. I tried these to see if there was a difference. Not only is the packaging different, but the smell is as well. They are not strong. They do not last. I cant verify if these are infact fake.

1141046,2021 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,Its definitely an eye sore and pretty big. Definitely cant get over that but its not something for decor... & I mean.. you have to clean the filter and the filter gets pretty dry. Otherwise its a pretty standard humidifier and does what it is intended to do. It makes a funny gulping noise that doesnt bother me much. The scent pods are pretty pricey and pretty useless. Dont buy this just for those scent pods.,5,2021
1141047,2021 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Good,5,2021

1141064,2021 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Its for oil vapor. NO steam comes out as you are not suppose to even put boiling water in it. I still tried and nothing. The hole in the lid is too small AND there is a hole on the side for any possible steam to escape. Its basically a plastic cup with a hole in a lid.,5,2021

I`m thinking the mist from the humidifier settled on the carpet and made it wet, but the carpet basically feels like the whole tank of water was poured onto the carpet. Now I have to clean my carpet in hopes that it won`t grow mold and smell like mildew. I have NEVER had this happen with a humidifier before.",5,2021

1141411,2021 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,"I`ve purchased Vick`s humidifiers for a long time. Unfortunately, this is by far their worse one. It`s extremely noisy (sounds like it`s puffing the mist out the entire time), it stops expelling mist once it has reached about 50% of the water in the container (see picture -- you can see the water level at where it stops), the water has to be cleaned out daily because whatever water is left inside ends up with a bunch of lint-like residue in it (see picture -- that black stuff at the bottom). The salt in the water, it`s not a recommendation, it`s required! If you don`t drop salt in the water, mist will not come out. If you`re looking for something temp that you don`t care having to leave behind or throwing away after a couple months, go for it. But if you`re looking for something long-term, definitely go for the more expensive ones. I don`t write reviews on anything I buy, but this one was so bad, I felt like I needed to.",5,2021

I`ve tried almost everything to help tame throat irritation, cough, & other symptoms. I bought this to give it a try. I`m so glad I did. It`s very easy to use and works great. I used it with my Vicks Steam Inhaler. You can add Vicks vapopads to the little slot in the back if you want. The vapopads make a big difference and south irritation quickly. One vapopad can be used for 2 days. I used one pad morning, afternoon, & evening for each of 2 days and it worked great. The steam helps a lot by itself but with the vapopads it soothes so much better. I woke up today with a really bad cough and sore throat. 5 mins with the steamer and vapopads and I found myself clearing my throat a couple times and my cough was almost completely gone & my sore throat was soothed.

I`ve tried almost everything to help tame throat irritation, cough, & other symptoms. I bought this to give it a try. I`m so glad I did. It`s very easy to use and works great. Simply twist top off and add water. You can add Vicks vapopads to the little slot in the back if you want. Plug machine in and turn it on. In a few minutes you will see steam begin to rise out of the machine. Place your face over it and alternate between breathing thru your nose and mouth for 5-15 minutes. It gives you plenty of steam. You can adjust a little lever on it to provide more or less steam. Two of the pictures I posted show the lever open and partially closed. What an amazing help this product has been. It quells sore throat, cough, & other symptoms down to almost nothing. My worst time has been morning and evenings. The aid of this device with vapopads has meant much less coughing, being able to clear out my lungs, breathing better, ease of sore throat, & better sleep. I saw one review saying there was not enough steam. I`m not sure what they are talking about because if there were more it might be a danger and burn your skin. This has just enough to not be dangerous and can be adjusted. The vapopads make a big difference and south irritation quickly. One vapopad can be used for 2 days.

Just seem to stay congested. So I thought I would give this a shot. Even added the vapor things, and used a towel to help concentrate it to my nose. Didn`t open me up, but helped a little.

I use my humidifier nightly so as a result I change the filter monthly. Whenever I change my filter I also throw in a new one of these.I`m honestly not sure how easy it is tell how effective these are, but, since I use my humidifier nightly I like the idea of keeping the air and water that is being circulated in my room as clean as possible.They are a bit pricey for monthly use, especially if you are replacing your filter monthly as well. That is about $10 per filter and $5-$6 for each of these totaling ~$15 in monthly usage cost for the humidifier.If that seems off-putting definitely consider a cheaper humidifier that doesn`t use filters.

Ive finally learned my lesson not to buy again. My kids easily get nosebleeds and chapped lips during the winter months so we have them all around the house. I purchased from my local store but want to warn others. Plastic quality is horrible and three water containers cracked while changing the water and slipping 12 inches or so into the sink or tub. My boys blamed each other for being rough with them but it happened to me too. I didnt learn my lesson and bought again and again because it was inexpensive, convenient to pick up at the local store and I had a hard time finding other similar warm mist models.I found it needs to be descaled at least monthly with a vinegar solution so be forewarned to be extra gentle while handling all parts.Ive had similar models of this brand over the years that Ive thrown away because of descaling issues but I was pleased with the value so I can attest to the lower quality of the materials used in the resent model.",5,2021

I ended up returning this humidifier though because, like a few other reviewers here, water started leaking from the on/off dial after a few weeks. Sometimes I could get it to stop leaking by propping up the side of the plastic bin I had it sitting in so that the water level tilted at a slanted angle but this didn`t always work. I`m just happy I took the advice of other reviewers and always put a leak-proof pan under this humidifier because otherwise my carpet would have been saturated the last time I used it. About 2-3 cups of water leaked out and it was frustrating since the humidifier worked fine except for this flaw. Amazon was kind enough to replace this one and I haven`t had reason to use the replacement yet because the weather has gotten warmer and so I don`t need a humidifier.

1142365,2021 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"This is the second of these that I have owned (the first was branded as Kaz, but it`s the same product). I`ve seen all the reviews mentioning leaks, and here`s what I learned from my first one: you don`t have to worry about leaks unless the tank develops an air leak. If the cap/stalk isn`t sealed fully or the tank cracks, etc., you will have an air leak - do NOT attempts a home repair or quick fix, if these things happen replace the cap and/or tank with factory parts. Once you have an air leak in the tank, the water WILL drain out uncontrollably into the tray, overflow it, and leak out of the unit (would you rather the drain hole wasn`t there and it flooded the electrical parts???). If you regularly inspect and carefully handle the tank, you won`t have a problem.My only pet peeve with my newer unit: The previous one I owned (the Kaz branded model) had a permanently-affixed bezel over the light (the plastic piece at the top that has the star shapes). On the newer model, it screws off - or, I should say, pops off, almost every time you lift off the tank! It has a lip that sticks out a little which catches a lip at the bottom of the tank and it`s nearly impossible to get the tank off without popping off the bezel.That`s the only reason I took off a star. I love this, it`s silent, on night mode a tankful of water lasts for at LEAST 24 hours, it`s attractive and my little one loves the projected stars and colors.",5,2021

We got this well known brand just for him, we trust in the brand and the product, but..., here is the thing, if you buy this item, please be prepared to clean it, and the process is not very easy at all, there are some areas where it very hard to clean, and I am not 100% sure what is going on (and I hope Vicks see this), but this item accumulates a lot of mold, and even before that it even gets slimy, its weird and hard to explain, but even the nozzle that goes on the bottom which lets the water out of the tan gets that way and its very hard to clean, oh and not to mention the inside of the tank (its terrible). So that is 1 HUGE issue right?! Then you have where the vapor goes, it a little cup like container where you pour it in, and that stays in there, and it forms in kind of like a jelly state, and it also is a pain to get it cleaned. Now I am not sure if the issues with mold is due to the fact that the item does not have a filter or what, but I would ask Vicks to please look into this, I dont think this is a safe product, would return it if I could.

1142601,2021 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I love this product. You just put a little bit into your vaporizer with water and turn it on. It helps clear stuffy noses and sinuses. I keep extra around for when the kid and I get sick.,5,2021

1142621,2021 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"So the thing about this product is that it works, however the face mask is not really designed to fit all styles of face sad to say. For me it works fine, however my wife on the other hand who I bought it for does not fit the contour of her face properly and therefore is just not as affective. The idea is spot on however because of that I cannot rate this as a great product for everyone and the sad part in the end is that you just don`t know if it will work until you get one and see how it is.Sorry I cannot be of more help describing that issue but its just dependent on the user.",5,2021

1142831,2021 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"This has a stronger smell than the original vicks. But I learned that as long as you don`t blast your humidifier on full power, it doesn`t smell as strong. So we run it at medium power, it lasts throughout the night and helps me and my baby with breathing when the air is dry or when we are sick. These only last one night though, so it could get pricey if you`re sick for a long time. If you try and run it for the second night, it might have residual aroma in it, but it definitely needs to be replaced if you want the full scent.",5,2021

My family keeps it in the bedroom for when either I or the baby get sick. That`s about the only time this thing comes out or when the air is so dry it hurts my nose to breathe. So far, it hasn`t broken down on us. We also like that we are able to put in the vapo pads for aroma therapy. We just wanted a simple humidifier that was small, effective, and give out aroma therapy.

But if you try to put the dial anywhere between 6-9 (0-10 scale) it will work it`s way back to 5 (12 o`clock position) from the vibration of the unit. Anything less than 8 doesn`t produce enough vapor to change the humidity level of a small bedroom (which is where it is used with a hygrometer for verification). So I have to tape the dial in position to prevent it from moving to center where it does nothing for humidity level. Also, when using overnight it makes a gurgling sound from the water moving from the tank to the base, which if you are a light sleeper is a problem. And if you use tap water instead of distilled and wind up with Serratia Marcescens (slimy pink stuff) it is not easy to clean the tank or the base very well.

1148030,2021 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,This is an extreme hazard for anyone to have in there home. My wife bought one at a local CVS and assumed because it was last one on the shelf and hat it had to be awesome. On the contrary. Apparently to create steam it`s a very tedious and delicate process. I say this because the periodic table of elements has to be incorporated while operating this sold on the shelf item. Use a dash of salt here and a dash of salt there. Balance out the minerals in your water depending on your system of water. Folks are we cooking supper or going back to chemistry class. All we wanted was a vaporizer for our 4 month old who has RSV. It ran for a solid 30 minutes when I our lights started to flicker and the voltage to the circuits dropped. It tripped the breaker and the cord was hot. I read instructions again as well as many reviews and seen where this was a common occurrence. This is a fire hazard and should not be on the shelves. I am certain that there has been catastrophic incidents that have yet to make there way to the light of day. I am a certified industrial mechanic who has a background in chemistry as well and I`m telling you that this should have been removed from the shelves way before now.....,6,2021

Really bad design that should have shown up in user testing. Second, it clogs faster than any of my previous units, and we don`t even have hard water. Cleaning it is also rather difficult.

So if you aren`t looking for something super strong be aware. This humidifier has a slot for 2 filters to go in at once. Although I would not recommend using 2.

I love the instant on feature of the cool mist and that it brings the temperature down in my room when steaming. Cleaning has been simple. I bought the little blue fishes with tabs to help keep the machine cleaner and so far it has been spotless. The machine does make a small amount of noise, but nothing that would keep me awake.

Same as you get from boiling water on the stove, but its safer and more steam is produced and concentrated. I breath it up my nose for 2 minutes 2-3x day to cure sinus congestion, headache and the clogged ears that occur from the sinus congestion affecting the ear`s tube in the neck. I add a bit of pure organic sea salt. It helps kill germs and makes more steam. Also good for the winter in homes that use dry heat. Dry heat dries out the nose, sinus and leads to infection, congestion. The warm steam vaporizer (also is a humidifier) prevents dry nose, sinus.These Vicks Warm Steam Vaporizers are the best. Much better than cool mist, spray brands. Vicks also lasts a long time. My old one was 3 years old. I dropped it, got the wires/contacts wet, corroded, so I bought this new one.

1154875,2021 / 07,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"I have been searching for a steam therapy machine that would be used to mainly help with my nasal dryness. It is not chronic but I believe it is an effect from C19. and steam therapy does work if you have sinus pressure and cannot breathe in regular air that is in your home. Instead of sticking my head in a pot to breathe in the steam, I thought this would work and help me relax while still breathing in hot hair. No ma`am. The water does not stay warm at all, a thermo cup used for hiking could work better for steam therapy. However with the Vicks pads in combination of the water works &amp;quot;ok&amp;quot; at best. If you are looking for actual steam therapy this is not what you are looking for . For my nasal dryness the only thing that has work is breathing in hot a** steam from a boiling pot of water. It soothes it right away, but not for long. I am by no means a doc , but do NOT take allergy medicine ( Allegra or Benadryl) if you have c19 with nasal dryness. it make it better temporarily and make its a hell of a lot worse after an hr in my experience, the active ingredient is suppose to dry out accessible mucus and if you a dry nose, it will only make it more irritable. breathe in some hot steam pull up a chair, place vasline protelum jelly on the inside linen of your nose and just breathe it in for how much you can take. It helps build moisture back in your nose , and get rid of the nasal dryness. I did this for 10 minutes every hour for one day and the next day I felt much better. still on the road to recovery but if you were like me and looking for something to help with that , breathing in that with be a healthier and most cost efficient method while ordering something new that is ACTUALLY steam therapy. Or you can use a warm compress ( rag, warm patch ) over your nose but again your healing with it not lasting long.",7,2021

1155763,2021 / 07,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Like that this item comes in blue and pink. The motor blows the cool air mist into the room and not just up into the air.

Now on the 3rd night I didnt have any sleep interruptions at all. My nasal passages have remained clear. The humidifier is the quietest one I`ve ever had so I`m finally able to keep it on at night. The size is perfect for my nightstand and it was very easy to assemble, clean and set up for first time use.

Add a little salt as instructed and start. But then an alarm went off at home. I wonder what would happen after 10 hours of spraying? I had to remove the battery from alarm . After about four hours, it inexplicably stopped, thinking it was out of water. But there was still half a pot of water in the kettle, and the reboot did not respond... For most of the day...

I wish that the cord was longer or that it was a little easier to hold near the face. Three steam flows are nice. Bottom gets hot but not so bad that I cant hold it.

1159680,2021 / 08,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,This doesnt fit the VEV400 model even tho it says its the same filter model. These are not the same as the filter that came with the Vicks cool mist humidifier. They have sharp metal pieces in the filter that make it so it doesnt fit well and the top of the humidifier doesnt close all the way in the back. Its also very hard to flip the filter every water fill up as the product suggests because it doesnt slide nicely into place like the original. Disappointed,8,2021

1159684,2021 / 08,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,I just like this product because I thought I was buying a steam inhaler when there was no cord or no batteries to cause steam. The product they sent me was either defective or just outright faults.,8,2021

It was a major struggle to get it to steam even after adding the salt per the directions. Even when it did steam it didn`t steam very well. The unit also gets really warm - warm enough that I wouldn`t put this anywhere that children may be able to touch it or on a surface that can be ruined by something warm. I ended up getting rid of this one and just buying a regular warm mist humidifier that works infinitely better than this steamer.",8,2021

1159831,2021 / 08,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"I got this item for one of my cats that had a bad viral respiratory infection. She is afraid of everything, so I couldn`t just bring her in a bathroom with steam in there from a hot bath, etc. like was recommended from the vet. I put this vaporizer in the guest room that she was spending a lot of time in. She was a weezy and sneezy mess. Although it did produce moisture in the room, and she did feel better after a few days of running it a few times a day, it could have just been the virus running its course. The machine at times would produce no steam, then too much, would sound like it was boiling and was going to explode, and would occasionally spit out hot water from the front grates for several minutes when first started. Definitely not safe, but I had it in an area that was not close to where she spends her time, and she was not interested in getting close to it. I put a towel on the floor in front of it to catch the flaming sprays of water....Still, easy to clean, fill, and under $15. I guess it is ok as long as you are watching it for explosions, and keeping everyone away from being close up on it.",8,2021

1159881,2021 / 08,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"I bought this humidifier today. I read the instructions, filled the tank, got it plugged in, etc., but was very disappointed when I turned the projection feature on, and one of the lights (located under the far left lense) did not illuminate. All three scenes (Safari, Ocean, and Space) only project 2 images. Meaning, the 3rd image from each category does not appear. Which looks like this; turn projector on, select scene category, image one appears, transitions to image two and it appears, and then it transitions to image three which is jet black (no projected image, the bulb does not illuminate). So there is this long awkward pause of darkness until the timer rolls back to the first image... I am not sure how to fix this issue, but it is very aggravating. Especially because I bought this product literally for the projection feature, and the specific turtle projection (my son`s favorite animal, and one of the three projections that does not work) :(",8,2021

The humidifier (with the vapor pads) was perfect. It was easy to get set up, noiseless in my opinion and did not disturb our sleep. The only thing I did not like is the lack of drainage at the bottom, I wish the water didn`t just settle in the main compartment of the machine and I have to empty that every day.

The item is definitely used and had cracks in the container that holds the water as well as oil all over it. There was blue residue on the top of it and dirt build up under the handle as well.

1160178,2021 / 08,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,We use this humidifier when the humidity is low in the bedroom due to AC or furnace running.We had another slightly different model before. I read reviews for a lot of different models from different manufacturers at various prices. I like that it sets on a table top and that almost all of the parts are plastic. It`s easy to take apart and clean. Our water leaves deposits on the heating element. I wipe it off with vinegar almost every day and add vinegar to the unit according to instructions every other day.

However, now having used it, i am completely satisfied with the inhaler.If you decide to buy one, make sure to read the instructions thoroughly before use, including proper care and maintenance (i.e. cleaning).It took exactly 6 minutes to heat up after filling the reservoir with cold purified water from my refrigerator. I used it for about 10 minutes and my throat, including my vocal cords, felt much better (not dry). There was still enough water to continue 5 more minutes but I decided to stop after 10.My biggest surprise was just how much steam it produced. It was great!The only open wuestion is how long it will work. Its very well made and easy to clean so I fully expect it to work for quite some time. If that changes, Ill update my post with the details.NOTE: If you have access to filtered water, I highly recommend using it. It helps make cleanup a snap! Its also much better for you than tap water, although tap water should be fine as a second choice. Also, tap water tends to contain a variety of elements that MAY shorten its life depending on their composition.Bottom line, I highly recommend the product!

Used distilled water and cleaned it regularly. It was quiet, easy, and did its job.Then out of nowhere, this thing started leaking like crazy. I took it apart, made sure it was clean, and nothing seemed to be wrong with it. I reset it and it was fine for a day or two. Overnight it leaked everywhere again, ruining the furniture it was placed on (we used a waterproof mat but to no avail). I turned it on just to watch was happening and the water was coming out of the dial.Of course, my return window was closed by this time. Theres no reason a $50 humidifier that has been taken care of should only last 2 months. Maybe mine was a fluke, but Ill avoid this brand for this type of product in the future.",9,2021

Literally no sound or steam, so I dont feel like it works. We have a large Vicks one and I needed another for a different room, but this is all that was available for pickup at the time. Size wise, its quite large and awkward to fit somewhere (it doesnt fit on a fireplace). The cap has a lock/unlock turn system and with the plug, it will unlock itself if the plug tugs on it slightly.

It may smell a hint of vinegar but it makes scrubbing off the minerals easier!It`s still relatively noisy on the lowest setting (Hi &amp; Lo only, NO middle setting). You`ll hear the gurgling and shishing sounds of the water being heated by the heating element on the Low setting and it gets Louder on the High setting.There`s a small cup on top of the vent to add any scented oil. It`s good for the minty or citrus oils during the winter to help open up the nasal passages.

This one you have to pour into this little slot near where the steam comes out. Im not sure if a lot of the liquid is getting vaporized and sprayed out. It says to pour just a bit on the slot and not in the water. For some reason this back residue of particles come out into the water after a night or 2 of vaporize use.

I dont think its very strong even on the stronger setting. It also doesnt feel like it gives out constant steam seems to do small puffs. Didnt open me up like the shower or boiling water does. Id return it if I could.,9,2021
1166957,2021 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,did not use this product. still in box once I found out you have boil water to use. Now I am stuck with something I can not use. and I lose my money Tell us if it can not be returned,9,2021
1166974,2021 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,"Easy to use, but it doesnt work well at all! I dont know if I got a lemon or not. Barely any steam is coming out after several tries. Just enough to fog up the mask, but not enough to help sinuses, even taking a deep breath in. So disappointed. Returning.",9,2021

1166992,2021 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Dealing with a nasty cold that was wreaking havoc on my sinuses and a cough that was keeping me awake lead me to this humidifier. I also purchased the vicks vapo steam and used it up. While the humidifier was great I was hoping that the vapo steam would be stronger but it still did the job. The liquid sits in a separate chamber outside of the water and the cool steam rolls over the top of it. Next time I will dig into my essential oils to increase the strength of the aroma. Regardless as is it did the job and finally let me sleep!,9,2021
1166994,2021 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,This purchase was from a friends recommendation and worth every penny. Dealing with a nasty cold that was wreaking havoc on my sinuses and a cough that would not let me sleep lead me to the vicks humidifier and vicks vapo steam. While the humidifier was great I was hoping that the vapo steam would be stronger but it still did the job. The liquid sits in a separate chamber outside of the water and the cool steam rolls over the top of it. I imagine this is perfect for children but I needed turbo strength. Next time I will add additional essential oils to amp up the strength. Regardless as is it did the job and let me sleep!,9,2021
1169614,2021 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,At first i though i broke it cause water guzzled down and when u lift it up theres water but thats the proccess it make vapor from the top water goes to bottom to cool we love it we can breath alot better thru out the day.,10,2021
1169615,2021 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Excellent steamer. You just have to know your nice balance of how much salt is needed. I have been using it for 1-2 months. No complaints so far. Not sure how cost effective this thing is based on electricity consumption. I would definitely buy it again. The reason I bought it for my newborn baby`s stuffy nose and sore thorat. This thing worked like a charm and he started feeling better within a week, symptoms which were lingering for a month.",10,2021
1169626,2021 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"Dont buy! Im not sure if mine was used and resold to me, but its a dud. Little to no steam comes out and it barely gets hot. The kicker: Amazon is not providing a refund even though Ive only had it for 5 days. Either buy in store to return if it doesnt work or find something else. NOT worth $30. BUYER BEWARE!",10,2021
1169638,2021 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,"This is the most frustrating device to use. It only holds a tiny bit of water, and doesn`t create steam right away. So, what ends up happening is that you have to wait appr 6-8 minutes before there is any steam. BUT DON`T WALK AWAY, because if you forget to come back for, say, 20 minutes... all the water is already gone. I, for one, have never like watching water while I wait for it to boil, so I can`t recommend this product.",10,2021
1169659,2021 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,"Awkward way of refilling it. You have to flip over the huge plastic container so then it drips all over the place. And the lower piece ends up being a pool. Lastly, on the lowest setting it pours out so much mist that it runs out so fast. Wouldnt recommend.",10,2021

1169673,2021 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"I`ve read these bad reviews and I have to say, I agree with every one of them about the smell of the lavender, eucalyptus and clary sage pads. They`re absolutely terrible. I did put one pad in vaporizer. Figured I paid for it, give it a try. Within 15 mins of my machine running with this pad in, the pad was swiftly removed and tossed in garbage- out to curb. Thankfully it`s a trash night. Might work for making a garbage can smell better- MIGHT. I instantly got a headache that went into a migraine faster than you can turn a light switch off. No kidding. No exaggeration here. It`s absolutely terrible. If you like extreme flowery cleaning smells then have at it. I did find out in requesting refund, it`s not returnable. Fine by me. It went into garbage anyway. I requested refund through Amazon customer service. Refund has been issued. God bless whoever likes these pads with the lavender blend in it. I`ll stick with the old vicks pads that work!",10,2021
1169684,2021 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,The noise of the motor is very noticeable. There is also a &amp;quot;dripping&amp;quot; sound as some vapor condenses on the exit tube and drips back into the reservoir. This could only work in the bedroom if the bedroom was beside a freeway.,10,2021

1169739,2021 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Everyone should get this product. You inhale steam with the vapo pads and it does wonders for your sinuses.

1169782,2021 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,"Looks like I have to buy another one because other products are too pricy for my budget. I have to buy one every year for sporatic use. Can`t seem to get the pinch of salt right I guess because it throws out too much moisture and wets the floor, walls and ceiling, or it barely mists at all. Sometimes it spits. Buildup happens quickly, and good luck cleaning it out. Cheaply made and doesn`t last, but again my budget right now just can`t handle something better.",10,2021

1169873,2021 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,I meanit WORKS but might be better suited for using in your open floor plan house. I had it on for 15 minutes and water was literally running down my walls it got so humid. Might be better used in a wood room as an indoor sauna. Theres also no switch so you have to unplug it to turn it off.,10,2021

1169916,2021 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"I purchased this product as both my wife and I have been experiencing dry sinuses and a dry throat. We both like the ease to operate it. It takes a small amount of water and will run for approximately for 15 minutes on one fill up of water. You can easily adjust the flow rate of the steam and the heat that is produced by the unit. It`s not necessary to put your face on the clear plastic piece where the steam rises, you can keep your face a couple of inches above the clear plastic and get the full effect of the steam that is being produced. I personally use it once in the morning and again at night before going to bed. I highly recommend this product!",10,2021

This is probably by 5th or 6th purchase of the 20ct box and I`ve yet to have anything negative to say about them. I use them in the Vicks humidifier as well as the wall plug-in whenever my little one even starts to come down with anything. I`m already all for anything Vicks but these really have been an asset in getting us through many sick nights an I cant imagine not having them on hand at all times. Not to mention the price is where its at every time as others can`t even compare.,10,2021

1169992,2021 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Bought this to replace the smaller humidifier in my sons room, the smaller one that was top rated here on the Zon only lasted for a year before it was no longer cleanable and workable. This one is much larger and does take up more space, however, it is much easier to clean the tank as the fill opening in the tank is pretty big. It is also very quiet when running and has a spot to put these little vicks scent pads,. We do use the pads when he is stuffy or has a cold and I do think they help but they are pretty pricey. The crazy thing is that this humidifier in a 12` by 14` room puts out so much mist that it will make the room like a rainforest. I had it turned up to about halfway one night and my wife told me the next day that the windows all had water on them on the inside. This was during the fall here when we are running neither the A/C or the heat so the room could just build up in humidity. It is a great humidifier and we are very happy with the purchase.",10,2021

The metal in the filter will scratch your hands as you try to smash it in. I used it for a total of 4 days and it already has mold even with the distilled water. So disappointed that I wasted money on these and regret not buying just Vicks brand but needed something here quicker since daughter had a cold. Throwing the rest in the garbage and will never recommend,10,2021

1170415,2021 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,There are a few reasons I enjoy this humidifier. I like that the mist comes out the top which can also rotate in the direction you want it. I like the fact you can us Vicks pads. And also like that the humidifier is very quiet.,10,2021

1170422,2021 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"After 2 weeks of constant use on the highest setting, the air is still very dry and the only reason I know the humidifier is on is because of the fan noise. I have flipped the filter yet, no noticeable improvement in vapor production. This may be related to the fact that it is an invisible mist humidifier.

1170425,2021 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"The humidifier worked well for about 8 months until it broke. Specifically, it stopped blowing the mist in the air. Luckily, I got it exchanged for a new one in Canadian Tire, as it was still under warranty.",10,2021
1170433,2021 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"I would not recommend this steamer to anyone. The steam is way too hot to expose to lips and facial skin even when face is elevated above the attached facial guide. And the Vicks vapors are so strong, they will take your breath away. And I only had steam vents open to the very minimum. Supposedly I cannot return this item, so please think twice before purchasing. Design is terrible.",10,2021

Anyways I love it ive had it for 3 years still works perfectly fine. The only complaint i have is that if you dont constantly clean it it will get a mold under where the water rests on and smell as well but i mean obviously u have to clean this to avoid it getting smelly. Overall i love it for when my kids are sick and i definitely would recommend it. And the People in the reviews that are annoying are probably people that are light sleepers or dont like to clean/lazy LOL,10,2021

1171163,2021 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"This humidifier is great when turned on. However, you have to clean it every 3 days or it will build up stains and water particles. The main issues I have aside from having to clean so often during the 9 months of Winter living in the WA States, it also leaks on the bottom leaving my floor soaking wet.I thought to give it another try and purchased another one, as it does steam up VIC`s for my toddler well, but same issues with the leaking.",10,2021

1171347,2021 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"I needed a sinus inhaler to help my elderly dog with a collapsed trachea. I ordered a nebulizer from Amazon but it wouldnt get to me for 6 days. We wanted something to use immediately while waiting for the nebulizer. We found this Vicks inhaler at Target. From the first use I knew it was a dud. It leaked hot water continuously. Sometimes it would spew a puff a hot steam instead of a mild mist. Thank goodness a child didnt have his/her face inside, the way its designed to use. We just put our little dog on a chair and put the inhaler close to his face. It helped him but dripped water constantly. Later that day I used again ~ the water still dripped everywhere but there was nothing coming out of the inhaler. So thinking we got a defective inhaler, we returned it and got a new one.The new one had the exact same issues plus the clear plastic inhaler piece kept coming off.",10,2021

1171354,2021 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"It clearly states in the instructions if you have hard water you NEED to add salt for this to work. Which is fine, however Im not sure if after a certain point where the water gets low it just stops working, or you need more salt. Which makes it inconvenient for overnight use if you have to keep adding salt. Also in the water there was a lot of lint like things each day. It works good, does make the room hot but just having to add salt constantly doesnt work for me. And its not as small as it seems in the picture. Its much bigger",10,2021

1171543,2021 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,It stopped producing any steam after 2 nights of use... wasn`t expensive just a waste of time really... may as well invest in something more expensive that actually works longer than two days,10,2021

1171571,2021 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Bought the extended warranty as vaporizers never last long,even when you use distilled water and keep clean.

1171575,2021 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"I used the V750 for years - I had about 5 of them, and they were pretty much perfect.On the high setting they would last for about 24hrs and cranked out quite a lot of humidity.On cold snowy days with two running I would get ice build up on the inside of my bedroom windows (no joke).This one seems to have a smaller tank, runs much hotter, does disperse as much humidity, and uses water MUCH faster, meaning refills are more frequent.As someone else said they do smell like chemically plastic when first in use, but it goes away after a few days.I used to clean the V750`s heating coil once a year (bad I know) and they worked for up to 5 years.I haven`t had this one long enough to know about it`s coil and mineral build up, but the excessive amount of heat leads me to believe it will need to be cleaned a lot more frequently.With that said it does what it need to do for $30, but the old one was much better - I still have one and it`s the only one I use in my bedroom.I tried to find the V750 everywhere but...no dice.",10,2021

He slept all night with this on, and his cough is much better today. We also used two of the vapo strips which I think made a big difference.

1171599,2021 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"They shouldnt call it a steam inhaler when its not. Its just a big plastic thing to breathe Vicks pads through. There are other/better ways to achieve this same outcome, in my opinion.",10,2021

1171694,2021 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,It`s much better to have a humidifier in winter when it`s dry,10,2021
1171695,2021 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"I`ve bought these half gallon Vicks humidifiers several times. What I like about them is that they create a nice, thick stream of cool steam and launch it well. I use one near my bed on an end table and position it so the steam of mist arches over and falls on my pillow for maximum humidification of my sinuses while I sleep. With this cool steam humidifier unit, I sleep well living in a semi-arid climate especially during the dry winter periods.What I don`t like about it is that they never last. You`ll get around 12 months of use and then either the ultrasonic transducer will give out or, more likely, the fan gives up and no longer puts out enough air. Vicks (and all the others who make this type of unit) just don`t put in parts that are going to be able to take a beating for much longer than about a year of continuous use. Know that going in and you won`t be disappointed. I`m willing to accept the short lifetime of these units as long as the are under the $40 price range. I`m giving it 4-stars because it does such a fantastic job during its somewhat short lifespan.",10,2021

1176588,2021 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"I bought this humidifier to replace an evaporative humidifier I had that broke. This humidifier is silent except for the loud bubbling water noises that happen every few seconds, which was an issue because I run a humidifier while I sleep.

1176645,2021 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"Very good value for money. Easier to clean than the other better-known brand because of the hole in the tank which is large enough to pass a hand.

1176654,2021 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,"Impossible to clean/drain completely because of the terrible design. You cant dump all of the water out, a quarter cup stays in there because theres nowhere for it to flow out of. Black crap builds up and floats around after one use. Not sure if its from the water minerals or what, but that in conjunction with how impossible it is to clean and empty makes it terrible.

We both have a lingering cough as one of the side effects from COVID-19. And every evening we seem to have more and more trouble with the cough getting worse. We're sitting and watching TV for three hours and the vaporizer is right between us blowing towards us. I realized we were inhaling all of this dust, minerals' that is in the air and settling on my Wood floors and furniture.

1176674,2021 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"Had this humidifier for several years. It does keep water in the base, that's normal. It's not that loud, in fact, the sound is quite soothing IMO. The only issue is wanting to add any type of liquid scent- lt causes a buildup over the heating element. And if you have hard water, same thing. The option to add a bucks pad on the side, that does nothing. The Heating element is going out so it's not producing as much steam anymore. Purchased a second one after 3 years. This is typical for most products. Be careful with filling up, leave the machine where you want it and fill it up in the tub. Add a pinch of baking soda for hard water. It's heavy. Be careful to not drop or it will break. Steam in high lasts about 6- 8 hours, steam on low can last all day. Red light means it's out of water or the pieces are out of alignment.",11,2021

I can keep it on my nightstand, no problem! it was the size that surprised me - it looks like a... big pot.( a recently new roll of toilet paper for comparison.) so it takes up most of the space on my nightstand. the shallow base is probably to help boil (?) the water faster but a compact cylindrical one would have worked too I guess? I didnt notice the size description when I ordered, so my fault. it warms up my small room in a few hours, so if you`re gonna keep it on all night I`d suggest keeping the door open, for safety.",11,2021

1176782,2021 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"If this one lasts as long as my older one (identical to new one), I`ll be very happy. The main key to all humidifiers is to use DISTILLED WATER! Clean at timed intervals as per included instructions and you should have no problems (at least I didn`t). The old one eventually stopped heating properly and water would condense before completely evaporating and puddle around the base, but it lasted for 10 years so no complaints.",11,2021

The tank lid has pink mold inside and out, and there is a holy about 2 inches with grooves, you literally cannot get into it.Aside from that, the unit started making a loud humming noise and the dial goes right past the max setting now.

1176815,2021 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,The quality of these Vicks VaporPads has decreased from times Ive used them in the past. The soothing scent dispersed from the humidifier doesnt last long at all. One hour at the most. Ill not buy again.,11,2021
1176819,2021 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,Im editing my review to a 3 star since the seller refunded me for this defective humidifier.I wouldnt recommend it though. It ships in the original box which puts the product at risk. I feel boxes should be placed in another box &amp; then shipped. My box did arrive in rather rough condition. The shipping condition possibly caused the humidifier to be defective. I honestly think the humidifier was defective from the start or Vicks quality isnt as good as the past. I put the VapoPads in this humidifier &amp; had the scent of it in the air for only 30 minutes. I feel a bad design.Original review: I had this Vicks humidifier for 1 week. It worked normal for the first 3 nights. After 3 more uses it would produce mist for 1 hour &amp; then it began to disperse spouts of water which soak anything around the humidifier which was mostly my bedding. This must be a defect. Im hoping I can return it.,11,2021

The valve at the bottom of the tank has started releasing too much water and is overflowing. I left it running overnight and refilled it early the next morning. Later on that morning the apartment below me called maintenance reporting a leak. I have carpet and didn`t realize it had leaked through. I also noticed a hairline crack near the top. I`ve never dropped nor hit it against anything. The last time I used it I filled below the crack to ensure it is not the cause of the leak.",11,2021

In the winter there is nothing better.1) Its easy to use2) easy to take apart to clean and sanitize.3) water capacity goodWe only use filtered/reverse osmosis water to keep it from calcifying.

1177356,2021 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"We use tap water and there is no issue with it affecting the performance of this vaporizer. However, we do have a water softener and our water is soft as soft can be (zero grains per gallon of hardness). The only complaint I have with this is that it is not &amp;quot;whisper quiet&amp;quot;, as advertised. If the dial is set on maximum, the vapor that is made in the bottom of the unit exits the unit on the top. Between the bottom and the top is a &amp;quot;chimney&amp;quot; to make a path for the vapor to go up and out. The problem is that some of the vapor condenses back to droplets and those droplets fall back down into the water reservoir in the bottom. When the droplets fall into the water there is a dripping noise that is very annoying. To avoid the droplets and the dripping noise we must turn the dial on the front down to about 50% and then it gets quiet. So, this unit can be whisper quiet, but only at 50% capacity. I reached out to Vick's customer service to inform them of this problem and to ask for a solution and their response was (and I summarize), it is what it is, there is not other solution to avoiding the dripping noise other that turning is down and reducing its output.",11,2021
1177369,2021 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Great little humidifier. Turns on very quickly and starts steaming. I should probably have purchased a top loader as the tank is very heavy for me when full. Good price for the item.,11,2021
1177371,2021 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I use this in my cool mist humidifier. I always use distilled water so I keep the setting on the lower end. With this I can keep the same water in the humidifier for a few days and don`t have to worry about mold or slime build up.,11,2021

Unfortunately, this one arrived damaged and I will be returning. Though disappointing I think this was just an issue that happened during transit. Based on the first himidifier which was the same model I can say that it is a pretty good basic humidifier. As stated this is for a small room. The tank is small so it can run out fast. On high it lasts about 8 hours.",11,2021

Have used this model for a couple years myself. (Bought this particular one for a friend.) Tried the Vicks scented patch sample that it comes with it put in the slot under the dial), and it was fine but wouldn`t buy them. Would prefer if it had a spot to put in essential oils, but you aren`t supposed to put them in the tank (likely because it will build up gunk and cause issues, I imagine). I clean it fairly regularly, every 2-3 weeks, just let vinegar sit in it for 15+ minutes and every so often take a toothbrush and vinegar to some areas to keep it clean and working.",11,2021

Tells you to avoid boiling water... so no steam. Has an extremely small aperture at the base, so no wafting steam.It`s only purpose it to warm and release the pads/oils for the purpose of inhaling the aromatics. While that might be good for some other purposes (relieving headache, or congestion, though I haven`t tried that), it is completely useless if your desire is to inhale STEAM.Exceptionally disappointed that a major company like Vick`s couldn`t appropriately name their product.I will be buying something that actually generates steam better than a cold cup of tea.",11,2021

1177634,2021 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"I received the Vicks 1 Gallon Filter Free Cool Mist Ultrasonic Humidifier, VUL545 well packaged and undamaged. I set this thing up according to the instructions and turned it on. The cool mist was visible immediately and seemed to work well at first. However after about 15 minutes of operation it shut down. I was able to restart it by shutting the unit off, removing the water tank and inverting it; then replacing the tank and turning the unit back on. This worked for about another 15 minutes before the unit again shut down. I am not an engineer but I believe that as the unit operates and the water level in the tank drops, a vacuum is created and the water flow is cut off, the nebulizer stops functioning and the fan shuts down. This unit does not have a tank venting system and I have to repeat this sequence every 15 to 30 minutes depending on the level I have it set at. This is a poor design and I will be returning it to Walmart for a refund.",11,2021

I typically use vaposteam liquid, but Target was out so I gave this a try. I like that there is still the menthol to help you breathe, but with a nice lavendar smell thats much more pleasant then just eucalyptus. One pad was enough to fragrance the room nicely.

Honestly it has helped me sleep great with no breathing issues shockingly, so I will have to order another for me lol. I seen a lot of reviews about leaking, but so far so good for me. Im guessing they maybe redesigned it? I use the max setting and its pretty loud which I enjoy since I sleep with a fan on usually for the sound, so this works just as good in place of a fan. Also gives off a cool air. My nephews used the sleep mode and it was mostly quiet. They love the night light mainly on this.

You can see it trying to make its way up the chute but doesnt go more than 2 inches. Will have to contact company regarding issue. There was water inside the base and a small amount inside the tank so i dont know what happened. Now lets hope the second one keeps going strong!",11,2021

1177918,2021 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Comes with Vicks Vapo pads however, we found the VapoSteam inhaler works much better then the pads and is sold separately in most store as Canadian tire didnt have the VapoSteam inhaler in stock when I purchased the unit itself. The cool mist of water is visible which is nice as then you know with just looking at the unit it is working. Would recommend to have at least one of these in your house for cold and flu season !",11,2021

1177953,2021 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,It doesn`t work well until you add salt and then corrodes with this black hard mineral or hard water buildup on the heating rods. You`ll have to take it apart (like removing screws) to clean it well until it happens again shortly. It also spits sometimes and will stain with the black crud build up that it constantly forms. I had one years ago and thought they would have made them better by now but no same piece of junk. Fooled me twice but never again!,11,2021

1178034,2021 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,It does exactly what it says it will do I have one in each of my kids room for winter time. Make sure you add a little salt at the beginning it will bubble away all night till morning.,11,2021
1178036,2021 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"It works. It does the job but minus a star for a convenience issue. The condensation reservoir fills very quickly. I use it primarily at night only when one of my kids have a cold. When running it all night until morning, I find that I need to get up in the middle of the night and empty the water that collects in the condensation reservoir within the base out of concern that it will overfill and leak if I don`t since it is already filled to the brim when I check it midnight. I think the reservoir should be deeper so the machine can at least run a full night without interrupting sleep! Other than that, it helped my kid`s congestion and cough so he could sleep comfortably. But I couldn`t.",11,2021

After a few hours of running the entire water tank began to boil, boiling water was squirting out of the top of the humidifier onto the tabe and floor. Thankfully my kids were in the crib and not playing on the floor. The boiling water ruined the finish on the wood end table it was on and made a huge mess but Thankfully no one was burned or electrocuted. There is no ground plug on this humidifier the company could face a serious lawsuit if someone were to get hurt.",11,2021

1178191,2021 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Worked well in a Vicks humidifier. A filter last about 4 weeks depending on water quality.,11,2021
1178192,2021 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,Great product. I just didnt like how theres water left over at the bottom of the white tray after each use. Pouring out water after each use is tedious,11,2021

This is the real deal because this is the sample of what I got when I bought with my Vicks cool mist vaperoizer. It cost more but it isn`t made in China. I do buy from China but I prefer to buy made in USA if possible. It smells great and works for me with sinus issues.,11,2021

1178249,2021 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I purchased this humidifier about 5-6 years ago and it`s still going strong. We have two of them; one for our room and one for our daughter`s room. And now we`re having a baby and we will be buying this same humidifier again. I think the mist is good and you can adjust it...on high its extremely efficient. It`s not loud and instead has a low sound which is soothing.,11,2021
1178250,2021 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Full tank lasts about 3 nights, theres no noticeable odor or loud noise while its on. Really helps with dry air and coughing. Also enjoyed the little scent packet sample it comes with, they add a nice touch.",11,2021

1178285,2021 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Iwish I had read the reviews before buying this. There is NO steam. I don`t understand why they call this a steam inhaler. It`s not. I have a sick kid i`m trying to help and now I have to wait for a new product to be shipped. I`m not happy. I thought maybe it had batteries instead of a plug but it doesn`t. It`s just warm water. You`re better off with a bowl of water. Don`t waste your money. This is going back. What a stupid product.,11,2021

Today, less than an hour after turning one of them on, I saw a puddle under my end table. At first, I thought I must have spilled something but then I see the humidifier seeping water from the power knob, of all places. Turned it off and unplugged it immediately because while I prefer the apartment on the warm side, an electrical fire doesn`t sound like a good time.

They are quiet, easy to clean and maintain and put out a decent amount of moisture in modest-sized bedrooms in a dwelling that cant have central dehumidification. The only drawback of the small (Mini) model is a small reservoir that needs filling 2-3 times a day depending on use.I purchased this larger model with the 1.2 gallon reservoir in March to avoid refilling it as often and am finally getting around to using it. It functions identically to the smaller model, with the same quiet fan, except it has a constant and noticeable dripping sound as condensed water droplets fall back from the outlet onto the vibrating mechanism that atomizes the water. Since its used in a bedroom, during the day its not a problem but at night I switch it off because of the sound. For heavy sleepers using it in a larger room it might not matter. We are medium to light sleepers so it remains off when we need it the most. I will probably switch back to using the smaller unit.",11,2021

1178634,2021 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"The only reason I use this steam vaporizer is that I want to humidify my kids bedroom without contaminating the air. What comes out of this vaporizer is pure steam since it boils the water and leaves all the minerals and impurities in the tank. My air purifier doesnt react when I use this vaporizer in my kids bedroom, but if I use a cool mist humidifier with tap water, it immediately detects the worsened air quality because of the minerals and impurities dispersed into the air.I use this vaporizer because my kids health is the top priority, otherwise I wouldnt - controlling the amount of steam is pain in the butt (you have to learn how much salt you add to the waterkinda primitive) and cleaning this vaporizer once a week is a big chore for me (disinfect the tank with bleach and soak the electric part in vinegar). This vaporizer also uses a considerable amount of electricity and you see the difference in your electricity bill (about $30/month in my case).ProsClean, pure steam doesnt contaminate the airConsNo easy control of steam output (you have to use salt)No on/off switchElectricity usageNo easy cleaning (I guess this applies to all humidifiers out there)",11,2021

They said in the manual that it may produce some white dust and after running it for about 3 days there was white dust everywhere. It stuck to everything in the living room and kitchen. The white dust doesn`t just settle on top of surfaces, it attaches to EVERYTHING including table legs, all sides of chairs, woodwork around doors and windows, lamps, tv screen, refrigerator etc. and the only way to get it off is to wipe it off so I have been cleaning my house for the last 3 days.

1178949,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Plastic is very poor quality. When filled to maximum you can feel the bowl is starting to deform. Burrs on all inner edges. Used for 15 minutes and the heater part start to overheat almost to the point of melting. Switched off right away will return to store for a refund this is second unit after 2 exchanges in a week. As per manufacturer unit can overheat and even blow the fuses(from manual) if tap water contains more minerals than needed. And same time manufacturer does not indicate exactly what chemistry tap water must have or even provide simple test kits to test the water before using it. So as per canadiantire return policy item cannot be returned for refund if box is open and as per manufacturer the overheating condition is warned and its bot a defect of the unit.

It cleared out my sinuses and (not to be gross) made my nose blowing way more productive. One vapor pad seemed to be enough (there`s 2 slots) and gave some nice soothing menthol scent. It definitely did take about 7-8 minutes for it to fully heat up and start releasing steam. Controlling the steam is easy and very helpful. It is a bit awkward to use because you can`t really hold it while in use, so you have to put it on a table and lean over it.",12,2021

I can get through two nights of running this humidifier at max output before refilling the tank (whereas previous humidifiers I could only get through one night). It operated almost silently for about 3 years, in the last year it started to be a bit noisier. Tank is easy to fill in a bathroom sink. Hole for filling is large enough you can get in there to clean it out. Maintenance: all I did was clean out the basin a few times a winter and the tank at the end of the season. We have city water here that doesn`t require softening, so I wasn`t worried about hard water issues that some folks have with filterless humidifiers. I bought this in January 2018 so it`s almost 4 years old.

We bit the bullet and ordered a new one from Amazon, and it started doing the same thing within a few months. Unfortunately it was after Amazon`s return policy, and I still couldn`t get in touch with Kaz, so we just dealt with it. We stopped using it because it was such a pain, and now here we are in winter again, in dire need of a humidifier, and the sound just won`t stop. I think now we are past any warranty, so we basically spent $100 on junk that we had to through away.

I took it back for a return and looking into the other boxes they had at the store , all was missing the same piece for the tank . Had to get another brand ..",12,2021
1179303,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,Works great. I do not like that mildew forms but thats expected with the water and moisture. It does makes a little buzzing noise.,12,2021
1179306,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Reset light will not come off even after all suggested attempts. Brand new and decided to use but cant causes of the reset light.,12,2021
1179307,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Love this so much because of the warm steam. Great for winter when the air is more dry. I use at night when I sleep and dont wake up with a headache. Also can add Vicks vapor when you need a little pick me up.,12,2021
1179317,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"Worked for a couple nights, filling the room with the vapors. But since then, has not emitted scent/vapors, not even when close up to it. Tried looking up online, but found no trouble shooting to try to fix it.",12,2021

Whoever wrote all those glowing reviews must enjoy water torture, but from us its thanks but no thanks.",12,2021
1179342,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Had humidifier for 2 days and liked it. Then noticed the tank was empty and it hadnt shut itself off. When I looked at it I found a crack in one corner of the tank allowing it to drain into the heating element. This unit couldve started a fire in my house because the emergency shut off feature failed.,12,2021
1179349,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I bought my first one in 2016 for my firstborn son and we are still using it almost every night. I bought two different humidifiers because they were cheaper for my second born and they broke within a few weeks. I decided to buy this one again because weve had our other one for 5 years and it still works great! We are so happy with both. We love the starry night and the noise is perfect. It actually helps my boys sleep better. The only negative I have is it is hard to clean especially in the water tank.,12,2021
1179354,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I received product quickly and it did everything I wanted it to do,12,2021
1179355,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"I have purchased this items twice. I used when my baby gets sick with flu and it helps to breath and sleep better. It has a pretty strong Odor, easy to use and the price is great with the amount of pads that come into the little package, and compared with the pricing to get this items at the pharmacy I consider this are cheap.",12,2021
1179364,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"I love the amount of water this humidifier holds as it lasts most of one day. The only thing I would improve on is adding a light to the interior of the container to help in seeing you have to shut if off at the end of day. It is difficult to see just the small light on the off and on switch. Other than that, it works just great!!",12,2021
1179377,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Does not make any noise and so easy to use,12,2021
1179384,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"From my experience, its not easy to find a warm mist humidifier, especially with the price like this one.

1179411,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,We bought this for our service dog. She loves it!! She will stand and just breathe in the moisture. She has allergies and this helps her so much!!,12,2021
1179412,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,The addition of the Vick`s vapor packets is a clever idea and it works pretty well (almost too well). But this humidifier is noisy. It gurgles like a fish tank. It even annoys my dog. I can`t run it at night.,12,2021
1179415,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,These work fine. But the container is smaller than Ive bought in the past. And it was the same price.,12,2021
1179416,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Works well.. if you dont get any vapor just add a pinch or two of salt and that solves the problem.,12,2021

These pads are a must-stock in our medicine cabinet for when either my husband or I are feeling sick.

1179460,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,It works well.I have purchased this vaporizer before and was definitely satisfied.I always have to add a little salt to get the steam flowing how we need it.It definitely helps with suppressing those late night coughing spells in my 5 year old and 1 year old.I prefer the Vaposteam liquid over the pads.The liquid seems to last longer.,12,2021
1179463,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Does NOT give off vicks smell what so ever. Even on the highest setting. Doesn`t specify what kind of water to use. Picture shows them using sink water though and I feel that will make the machine break. So we are going to return. Everything keeps getting made cheaper but getting more expensive.

1179499,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,I used it in the bedroom for about one year. It still has a strong burning plastic smell. I have to stop using it in kid`s room. A new warm mist humidifier from another brand doesn`t have such plastic smell. I am worrying.,12,2021

The amount of bleach they recommend doesn`t cut it and it likely needs to be done every single time (stain is still there after several bleachings). I`m currently shopping for another one. Shame, this was worked amazing. Just really hard to open and close the tank plug when refilling, and impossible to clean the hard to reach areas. I tried q-tip, toothbrush, toothpick -- nothing can reach/bend/fit into the one area to clean it. Sadly will be throwing it out. /",12,2021
1179520,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,This thing is very small so pay attention to water capacity. It never uses all the water and theres always at least a cup or so of water left sitting in after it kicks itself off. Not impressed at all. I should have read how much water it holds. Youre going to be filling it FREQUENTLY,12,2021
1179527,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I bought 2 of these last year to replace the cool mist humidifiers that I had. I love them!

1179565,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,This is one of the most underrated products. It is an absolute life saver for colds or sinuses. It makes a huge difference in ability to sleep and reduce coughing especially if used with vaposteam product.,12,2021

1179599,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Works well for a small room on low, however if you use it on high in a small room it creates a fog affect which probably wouldnt be safe. As far as using it in a room 17X15 on low or high it works very well and is quiet",12,2021

1179939,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"The Vicks Filter Free Cool Mist Humidifier has all the features I was looking for. It holds a little over a gallon of water on the medium fan setting and will last you a little over a day before it needs to be refilled. I do use distilled water which will prevent getting the white film on everything. It puts out the right amount of mist and you can adjust the mist output on the top of the tank to select the direction of the mist. It is very easy to remove and refill, and it`s a big plus not having to buy and change filters. If you maintain it weekly it will be scale free and not have the mold build up. Just follow the instructions for cleaning in the manual that is provided. I like the option of adding a Vicks sccent pad if you are feeling a little congested.

1180130,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Didn`t use product. Site advertised eligible for refund. Seller won`t give refund unless I pay large shipping and restocking fee. False advertising.,12,2021
1180136,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"This humidifier is amazing, its great quality and easy to use! Its worth every penny.",12,2021
1180137,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"we use it every night, there is a slight sound of the water heating up, but it`s like a white noise to us",12,2021
1180138,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Love it,12,2021
1180141,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Just an amazing machine to have. Love it.,12,2021

1180146,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Way Too Big and Had a strong Chemical smell with white powder everywhere! Had to send it back!,12,2021
1180158,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,It works well in Dehumidifier,12,2021
1180160,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"I have only used this humidifer for a short time, but it works nicely and holds a lot of water, . However, it makes crackling noises when used from the medium to high setting. In a quiet bedroom this can be very distracting. Also, the light on the dial can be distracting if a dark room is desired for sleep. I put a piece of black tape over it. Still, if you need a humidifer with a large water tank that can put out a lot of moisture and don`t mind the noise, this product would be a good choice. It remains to be seen how long this will work.",12,2021
1180161,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Received item quickly. Easy to fill and use. It is fairly quiet. Would suggest also purchasing the Vicks vapor pads for use in it to help with head /chest congestion. Great tool for any home.,12,2021
1180174,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Didnt steam enough and was spill a lot of water all over,12,2021
1180175,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,My son has asthma so we bought this vaporizer to help with his breathing. It has worked wonders. The only shortfall is you have to clean it regularly and it requires salt to diffuse.,12,2021
1180191,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,"This worked great for a few months. Now its extremely loud (keeps me awake through the baby monitor), and produces a black residue that I can see when I take the tank off. Because I believe this black stuff to be caused by heat, coupled with the burning smell weve noticed a few times, this is no longer safe to use as it is an extreme fire risk.Extremely disappointed. Do not recommend.",12,2021
1180203,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,Its cute. Night mode is very quiet. But.it is a humidifier that does not humidify at all. We have been using every night for two weeks with no change in air quality. This is the only humidifier Ive purchased that did not add moisture to the air. Very disappointed because its very nice otherwise.,12,2021
1180206,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"READ the reviews!! It was cheaper on Amazon than at Walmart so I bought it without reading on it much, but its been plugged in maybe a week total since it came in and today it no longer works. Lights on, its trying, but the water level hasnt changed and nothing is coming out. Everyday I washed it there was black and gray pieces in the bottom, so god only knows what its putting out. Good luck!",12,2021
1180209,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"I didnt like this product. It doesnt have an on/off button so I have to consistently unplug it. The top is supposed to stay locked but its very loose and unlocks very easily. The steam doesnt come out really good. Overall, it is a product that I wish I could return.",12,2021
1180210,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,Waste of money. After using it one time the low water light would come on instantly even with a full tank.,12,2021
1180220,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,I don`t know if it`s a &amp;quot;safety precaution&amp;quot; but this thing has no steam. The one I had years ago had way more steam but perhaps people can`t be trusted with hot steam anymore. I will be returning this ASAP.,12,2021
1180222,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,"Wow! Bought one last year, loved it, 4-5 stars. The design has changed &amp; the unit is not as efficient as its predecessor . A disappointment.",12,2021

1180272,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Suffering from chronic sinusitis, this is a blessing. Read negative reviews, but even without directions, easy to use. Just make sure side vent is in the closed position and you can rest face on the mask. When its fully opened it releases more steam to face. Just move face back and inhale steam from a 3-4&amp;quot; distance. As far as it burning, that will happen if you over fill reservoir and water leaks onto internal parts. Be savvy and you will love this. I just received this two days ago and am seeing, rather feeling congestion in head relief already. Highly recommend if you follow directions and use common sense. ( not insulting, just basing facts)",12,2021
1180274,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"The vicks pads are strong. But I am basing it on the one enclosed with my steamer. I believe personally that once the pads are depleted you can re-use with a drop of eucalyptus, or peppermint oils. They do clear my sinuses.",12,2021

1180295,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,I have one of these in every bedroom in the house. I use them all winter long and when the kids get sick. The vicks pads work great to help them breath. Really pushes out the mist when on high. Great for small rooms,12,2021

1180350,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,No good. Filter goes bad real quick. You are better off getting a hot air one.,12,2021
1180351,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,Works great. Quiet. Wish the water reservoir held more water.,12,2021

1180383,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"I just wanted a basic humidifier that was easy to clean and this is your best bet. Read the directions first (you need to clean it with a solution of water and vinegar to prevent mold, and only fill with distilled water, NOT tap water). Don`t bother with Vicks or any type of essential oils. This is simple and perfect to just hydrate near your face if your room is super dry. Has multiple speeds of mist, and you can set the timer. Doesn`t leak, and the directions are easy to understand. Good for both adults and kids. Just remember to clean weekly and fill with distilled water when in use.",12,2021
1180384,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,Love it! I have used it for the winter months. Its great! I feel the difference when I havent turned it on.,12,2021

1180401,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4,"Super easy to set up&amp; use and is also very quiet. But it doesnt let out a good amount of mist, nor do the vapo pads really work.

Back to the shape, it is impossible to fill the revisor in most sinks dude to the size and shape. But its also as equally as impossible if you need to empty water out as the weird oblong shape creates an area for water to hide when trying to empty.

I put a piece of masking tape over the green light for my bedroom one as it was too bright. The key is where you position it and turn the knob - away from an empty wall is best.For cleaning I use q-tip for the hard to reach areas. The only issue is that sometimes when I open to empty in the morning the seal is really tight and hard to twist.I had one that I ran non stop without maintaining it as well and it was the cause of a burning smell in my kitchen a couple years ago.One issue is that the humidifier is so tight inside the box that it is not simple to just remove and the box needs to be torn apart.I have asthma and live in Los Angeles - this has helped me sleep restfully and maintain moisture in my room and I am never sick.I have saved the vapo pads and use them in winter time The scent is not overwhelming and lasts a few weeks before having to toss. The vapo pads come in a plastic white sealed pouch.The mini humidifier fits on small end table, mist is not too noticeable and the chord is plenty long. There is a handle to lift and carry to add and remove water. I prefer to use bottled water. I fill to the top line and always have water left in the morning, no matter how high I fill it up.

1181503,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"Not noiseless but much quieter than cheaper hot vapor humidifiers; very similar in volume to cool mist ultrasonic humidifiers, though character of sound is different (more of a light gurgle). Similar in physical size to overnight ultrasound misters. Automatic shut off works well; full tank on high lasts 10-12 hours.",12,2021

1181507,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,The dripping sound is unbearable. Sounds like a leaking faucet all night long. I have never had a humidifier make this noise before. Truly terrible,12,2021

I filled, closed, and sealed the water holder, but when picking it up, the bottom seal popped out (though it was in the locked position) and water spilled all over the bottom portion. When this happened, it stopped working. This replaced our former version of this product which I have used for years, and this never happened before.

1181621,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"We had a another humidifier which grew mold on the inside and was impossible to clean due to the small opening.This humidifier doesnt have actual mist shooting through like others which means theres no need to protect our furniture from water damage. The opening is large and easy to clean if needed, but we havent had any issue with mold like we did with other brands.We know we should be using distilled water, however we just use the water from the tap and this humidifier has been going strong for 2years+.The filter replacements can be easily purchased on amazon and they last a reasonably long time (we run ours every night for 10ths+)10/10!",12,2021

1181654,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,"This product does exactly what it promises. It worked after 15 or 20 minutes the first time I used it. Make sure you always lock the blue top so that the arrows are aligned and add enough water without overfilling (there`s a maximum fill line) and it should begin emitting steam in about 15 minutes. I add a little salt (just a couple of shakes) and mix it in the bowl. I`ve read several negative reviews on the Internet, but I`ve purchased these in the past and every unit has performed as expected. So when I saw a sale on Thanksgiving weekend for under $12, I knew I had to buy another one to moisten the air for the days when the electric heat dries out my nose, eyes and skin.",12,2021

Cannot fill base without taking it apart and setting wet bottom of steamer center on counter or floor. Cannot empty tank to clean sediment out because of where opening is and there is a lip inside that keeps water from pouring out. Noisy when running and spits water out onto floor. More trouble than its worth, so Im throwing out.",12,2021
1181676,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,"HonestlyI have NO IDEA why this has such great reviews!! I think it's one of the most disgusting smells in the line of aromatherapy. I'm not crazy about the regular vapor pads either. I will never buy either one again. I have used the ones I did buy by soaking them in dish soap with hot water to remove the smell, rinsing them good, squeezing out the moisture and letting them completely dry out. Then I add my own favorite essential oils to the pad and inserted it into the allotted slot. However I mostly now use the medicine cup chamber insteadless work! There are lots of great smelling breathing' essential oils out there.",12,2021

1181700,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,2,You fill it up with hot water and place a tiny vapo piece and Inhale. It`s just as useful as filling up and pot of water and stem and inhaling it,12,2021
1181701,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,1,I didnt realize that this item wasnt electric (my fault for not paying attention when I purchased it) but the directions say that you cannot use boiling water and hot water doesnt provide steam. I started to send it back but decided it wasnt worth the effort.,12,2021
1181702,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,3,I guess I didn`t read the information correctly because this is just a device you put hot water in then put to your face. I could do that with a coffee cup. Disappointed,12,2021
1181712,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,5,This is a good product for the price. Works very well for opening up sinuses. Just be careful as water pot is very hot and is easy to spill.,12,2021

Unless you live in a really moist location and the humidity is high enough, this will help a lot. Its cheap and uses electrodes to get the water steamy and the air moist. If youre water is too soft, lacking conductivity, just add salt to get it up. If the steam is coming too quickly, dilute water with distilled water. With proper care it will last a long time, and its cheap, so replacing it eventually is a non issue. Ultimately youll have moist air.",12,2021
