1126476,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,helps me breathe while I struggle to fight off a cough Likes FeelingFormCoughEase of use,5
1128051,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Used this with my Vicks warm humidifier since first use. After about a month I check the inside of the water boiler and it was DISGUSTING.,1
671017,2019 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"That`s what I needed to treat my baby boy asthma. He can sleep overnight without coughing. Perfect price . No needs of filter . I can use oil if I want. Plus I received many compliments about my skin look- yes, we share the bedroom. I forget about my dry face skin . I also bought for my friend",5
1140575,2021 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I used this product twice. Third time, the water wouldnt heat up. Now Im out $40, ill and dont have the much needed steam inhaler.",1
677991,2017 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"It did help clear out my nose, but I`d rather just take a shower. Same effect nose-wise and way more pleasant. I had to get into a physically uncomfortable hunched over position to use it. It has to be on a flat surface, and if you put it on a table, you can`t sit in front of it and put your face over it because it`s too tall. The steam dissipates as soon as it gets out of the hood, so to actually get it into my nose required sticking my face closer in than I`d like -- my face was uncomfortably hot and I worried about burning myself.",3
678708,2017 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I`ve always had a problem with dry throat especially since the heater was on full blast during the winter time. I always woke up like something was stabbing my throat but after having purchased this product and using it the day it arrived, it immediately alleviated my symptoms, made me breathe better and it made me feel more comfortable. It`s easy to use and can be used with the proper vicks product along with it to clear stuffy nose. I would definitely recommend it.",5
1191074,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"These are amazing, just buy em`.Instantly gave me nostalgia from being a young boy with a cold and my mom putting the rub on my chest. It`s like that except your whole bedroom =]",5
1113393,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This humidifier is perfect for me. So easy to fill in the bathroom sink (morning and night) and enough steam to stop me from zapping my poor cats and getting zapped myself. It doesn`t steam up the windows, which I believe is a good thing. It is used in a 630 sq ft space and I am thrilled with the results. I`m waiting to have a cold so I can use the Vicks pack to help with congestion. This was a great choice!",5
1134220,2021 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I was very happy with this but it stop working and makes a VERY loud noise. It hasn`t even been 2 months!! Very disappointed.,1
665099,2019 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Doesnt have a strength gauge so when I left it on overnight, it made my walls drip water and my ceiling fan flung water off of it after it had been on. It made my FIRE ALARM go off in the middle of the night.",1
674322,2018 / 08,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Shipped fast, good for colds.",4
1084697,2020 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Great! i love it. Is very easy to use and helpful for my kids to breath.,3
673385,2018 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Ive bought two of these now, one for my house when I watch my grandson and then one for my sons house. It works really well especially as a vaporizer with the Vicks vapor pads. My grandson tends to always have a runny nose and this helps him breathe so much better when hes sleeping. Love the cute projections too.",5
673232,2018 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This is a nice unit and well priced. Previously I had a Sunbeam which worked well for 5 years but conked out due to old age. This unit is easier to fill. The screw cap is easy to replace when filling and the unit is easy to clean. I have soft water and notice the unit must be cleaned every week if used continuously due to the buildup around the heating unit. I like the compact design.The option to include liquid Vicks in the unit is a dud. The container for the Vicks relies on evaporation since it does not mix with the water. It does not provide much if any benefit. So I decided to pour the liquid Vicks directly into the water chamber. That works much better and one can smell the Vicks clearly. However, it tends to build up and makes the water in the canister soapy. So I discontinued that and quit using the liquid Vicks completely. It is a nice idea but just did not work for me. I suggest the old fashioned method of putting some Vicks directly near or in your nose like we did as kids and I still do today. That works better.",5
1141379,2021 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,These things are AMAZING for congested babies who cannot take medicine yet. They ease my toddler`s breathing (and mine!) when we get congested.,5
1245527,2022 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Been using this for weeks round the clock for my husband post cardiac surgery. He also has COPD/ Agent Orange. It does need new filters often when using it so much but it has been excellent! His cough improved and he is healing well. Vicks always is a name to rely on!!,5
1114865,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I received this item a few months ago it works terrible. The mold is terrible. As far as I am concerned it was a waste of my money! I am throughing it in the garbage. Likes Setup Dislikes RespiratoryCapacityMistConvenience,1
1176850,2021 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Loved everything about it,5
1179415,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,These work fine. But the container is smaller than Ive bought in the past. And it was the same price.,4
1252814,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This nebulizer takes 13-14 minutes to heat up (not 6 minutes as in the description) and then delivers very poor qu7ality, uneven steam, constantly spitting and sputtering. I was hoping, because of the national brand `Vicks` it would be superior quality. It`s not.",1
1202534,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"works great, does get a little hot, pull my face away sometimes",5
668309,2018 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Good product, works well and The kids love it! Just wish it had a timer to shut off the nightlight after a while. Other than that love it!",4
675241,2017 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Not perfect by any stretch....needs salt to work, very loud on initial start, stops working when it reaches half full, endless amounts of black debris fills the bottom, difficult if not impossible to clean out unless you take it outside and use a garden hose. As they say, you get what you pay for. For the 5 or so hours it produces steam, it`s good. Not so sure it`s worth all the other hassles.",2
671437,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Actually bought this at Walmart because I was sick and needed one quick. I got this one because it was at the higher end of the price options and I wanted a good one. I did not get a good one. If you use the VapoStrip slot and you push the strip in all the way you need pliers to get them back out. The filter doesn`t stay wet enough so the top half turns brown and crusty.,2
1114724,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,It doesn`t work. You can`t return. Very frustrating. Hope I didn`t buy it!,1
668705,2019 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Highly recommend! I`ve had a few of these and would absolutely buy them again. There`s a spot for a Vicks pad, which doesn`t emit too much smell in the room. They`re very simple to clean. The internal parts don`t get nasty like my hot water humidifier does. Small glow on the switch but not too bright. Emits a good amount of water but is adjustable. Quiet.",5
663769,2019 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Efficace, remplissage facile, nettoyage un peu difficile",5
1226183,2022 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Good value for the money,4

1048422,2020 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"keeps air moist and my kid loves the different lights, it gets used every night and this is our third one in almost 3 years. also love the option to put vapopads in, they`re great!",5
1115252,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Have it in every night,5
1251282,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,easy to set up and use. perfect for my bedroom.,5
1188944,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Item used for about 10 days, crack in top of tank showed up last night",4
929213,2020 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,It leaks all over and is really loud,1
1114204,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Works well,5
926925,2020 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Worked as described.,5
1074104,2020 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Although it works everytime I would wake up the water was black I did not feelSafe having this around my baby. Returned.,1
677842,2017 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"works well, easy to clean and refill. works for 2 nights easy, could use another night tho!",5
1181787,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Nice scent , convenient and good quantity",5
1200429,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I wish it had a thermostat to control the temperature but I don`t know of any of these type of inhalers that do. A little expensive . Works good. the steam seems to be a little lax ,maybe if the water chamber was bigger or a redesign of the route that the steam takes to exit the chamber would make this a better unit for the price.It`s adequate so I`m not going to return it.",4
665005,2019 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Great for the price.,5
677446,2017 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Works great.,4
671419,2018 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This is my first experience with an ultrasonic humidifier. I`m used to the hot steam type or the evaporation type. This thing really blows out the mist! It seems to do the job efficiently and quietly. My only issue is with the design. It`s sometimes a little tricky to align the reservoir onto the base without a lot of jiggling around. This is relatively minor, and perhaps it`ll become easier as I do it more often.",4
664484,2019 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,i had a stuffy nose and this literally cleared me up within 2 days of use. It is awesome!. I also used vicks vapor rub cream on the side of nose and on my chest and throat to go with this vicks humidifier with vapor rub pad. totally awesome for a senior who always gets sick!,5
1112105,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I bought two of these. I like the warm air steam myself vs the cool mist. I still use both cool and warm mist. This vaporizer needs to be filled daily because it will only last 2-3 hours with a little salt added to make it steam more. Make sure you clean the plastic tank every couple of days as it will have little black particals on the bottom. Its from the heat element that you cant see . I like it a a lot as you cant find anything cheaper. Its not very stylish but puts out enough warm steam from keeping the room from being dry.,5
674783,2018 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Although we have a 12 gallon whole house humidifier, the humidity in the bedroom was barely 30%. I have dry eyes and wanted a warm air device. After googling `vaporizer` vs. `humidifier`, I realized that for the price, I could not go wrong. It is perfectly fine and raised the humidity in the bedroom to 60%. It is totally SILENT. Read and follow the directions carefully. I added 2 drops of lavender oil and a small pinch of salt, as instructed. It takes 20 minutes to warm up. It barely used up half the 1.5 gallon bowl of water after 9 hours. I have been emptying it each morning, and wiping the element,and the bowl with a disposable disinfectant wipe. I wash it out with vinegar every 4 days.It is supposed to go off on its own if the bowl is empty, but mine is never empty when I wake. I immediately empty the water , as instructed. Once I got into the routine, it was a no-brainer. For $14.95, it is amazing.Just take heed, that it is not refundable....Isuspect because, a vaporizer is considered a medical device.",4
673225,2018 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Works great but wish it was bigger,5
669246,2019 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Good quality,5
1140683,2021 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Replaced a smaller unit from Vicks that stopped working.This one is great and lasts 2 nights instead of one.The only difference is peculiar to only my situation I`m sure.I have bookshelves over the dresser this sits on and the strange reservoir design requires vertical insertion and removal which is fairly tight with the space available but not a deal breaker.I`d recommend this humidifier to anyone and with a few more practice sessions it will be as easy to refill as my old Vicks vaporizer.,5
1225863,2022 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I first purchased mine because the filters on my old cumbersome to handle had begun costing a fortune. I use it when congested, and the Vicks insert is great. With or without the insert, it is a terrific machine. The second one is for a NYC apartment dwelling friend whose sinuses dry out from excessive heat. It is perfect for a large bedroom. And, oh so silent.",5
669663,2019 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Product is bad. It keeps tripping the breakerWhat do I do?,1
1017449,2020 / 07,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,It is not working just open it today. I don&quot;t have an option to return it .,1
672184,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Loved the smell and helped when I wasn`t feeling well,5
1166172,2021 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Hereandthere did not leave a review,1
665468,2019 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Worked okay for about a year before coating on heating element began to flake. Not sure I want to risk possible inhalation of that material. Even using filter water, deposits regularly formed in this area that I would have to dissolve with vinegar/baking soda. Not sure I want to reorder a new one. This should have lasted longer",2
664152,2019 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Great product - does the job I purchased it to do.,4
668775,2019 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"My daughter`s cough was significantly improved with the first night of use. We have hard water so we are only using distilled water in the unit, so I`m hoping to have many years of use out of this product.",5
674214,2018 / 08,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I have a newborn baby, I did alots researchs on different humidifier. This Vicks brand stands because its reviews online and price. I am happy about it.",5
1165191,2021 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Very good new humidifier that replaced mine that broke after 7 years. Hopefully this one last this long! No complaints for now. This was the only store where I could find them at!!!,5
668242,2019 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,It stop working after using it for 4 months. Very disappointed.,1
1160953,2021 / 08,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I don`t know how this product have so many 5stars. I am using it from a week now and it`s not throwing any smell. I followed all instructions correctly. I don`t know if I received a defective product or the product is useless itself. But I am very disappointed.,2
1254575,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Our water gets pink slime in it if it sits for any period of time. Mostly we see it in the showers/tubs, but we no longer get it in our humidifiers thanks to think fish! I was skeptical but it totally worked for us. I just came back to buy one for my daughter`s humidifier.",5
1149705,2021 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,It`s works but it will NOT LAST LONG !!,1
1247340,2022 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Works as advertised,5
672588,2017 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Do not buy. It has only been two months that I bought this from amazon & its stopped working already. Totally garbage Humidifier.,1
928610,2020 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Works as it should good product,4
664625,2019 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This was an okay humidifier for what it was used for, I mostly got for the stars that went on the ceiling, but for an actual humidifier i would prefer warm mist. But I do like this one because it can be run continuously, but the downside is having to replace the filter so much, thwy can add up for sure!",4
676496,2017 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"On the 2nd winter with this one (one tank cracked -happens if you drop it). We have 2 and love them. The light could be too bright for some: cover it with tape or a towel. It might drip when you pick up the tank to refill - of course, all of them will. Does not leave moisture around it, but I keep on a folded bath towel to protect hardwood just in case. It does not leave a fine white dust as other products are reported to do. It gurgles sometimes. If you can sleep through any other noises in the house (refrigerator, furnace turning on, etc), you can adjust and will not notice. Yes - it must be cleaned if you use tap water. Distilled vinegar is so cheap and will soak off deposits in an hour or so. High water mineral content requires weekly cleanings here. For the price, this is an excellent appliance that really does its job well!",5
1074281,2020 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Puts together easily,5
674584,2018 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,It` too weak,2
668882,2019 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I would have given the humidifier 5 stars except they switched the handle to the other end of the water container, and it`s very awkward to grab and go, and to put back on the base now. If I were left handed, it would work fine!",4
666005,2019 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"My son has been taking prescription meds, over the counter meds for allergies/congestion...nothing. Used this ONE time for 10 minutes, and the drainage literally ran like a faucet from his nose. He slept peacefully, breathing through his nose, for the first time in weeks!",5
1102909,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Love,5
671855,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"We bought 2 of these and one started making noise after two months of use, we got a replacement under the warranty and now the replacement and the other original one both makes noise. Thats 3 in under 14 monthst that do not preform as they are suppose as they should.",2
663911,2019 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,The best Humidifier on the market,5
1215046,2022 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Have been using for years to help me sleep soundly at night,5

1179681,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I will never purchase this item again not strong at all barely has any type of steam coming from it waste of money,1
1062231,2020 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Mine started dropping black chunks and now turns all the water black. It looks like it could probably kill you if you breathe it in. It trips breakers in every circuit Ive plugged it into. And melts extension cords. I have these before, so I know Im not causing this. Ive had it 3 days, barely ran it, and its deteriorated this far. Based on the million reviews of others crapping out the same way, Im guessing I didnt get an unlucky defective one. They sell them this way.. Which means some cheap idiot at vicks swapped a components material type to save and make more money, but was too stupid to know that it would f it up. And instead of correcting their mistake, they negotiated a no-refund policy with retailers w disregard for human life and the reputation of the brand.. Vicks has sold out. Which makes me wonder what else theyve done to every product?? We ARE the experiment.",1
1202632,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"After using it for a month, it started emitting a burning smell when it got low on water and actually emitting smoke (not mist) like it was about to start a fire. Tried it again and did the same thing when water was low. I would not leave this alone to work, as could be a fire hazard.",1
1031207,2020 / 08,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Just fill it up with regular water; some say it requires some salt; guess it all depends on your water source.,5
1032888,2020 / 08,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"great product, good built",5

952808,2020 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"It works for more than five hours vaporizing the room if you need to constantly fill it with water, it is very practical and economical.",5
667977,2018 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,It really helped my 4 year old breath comfortably during his last cold. The smell is okay and it`s not too strong. At least not for us.,5
664612,2019 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Love it!,5
930339,2020 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Great product to add to the warm steam humidifier to help ease congestion. The scent is not too overwhelming and it helps so much with nasal congestion.,5
674551,2018 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I just purchased this item from Walmart for $19 and its exactly what I was looking for. The starry night looks like some led blobs on the ceiling (and I dont have vaulted ceilings) and its not as easy to use as youd think. I read the Quick Start Guide and i ended up filling the bottom half with water, which is now all over my bedroom floor.... but all in all, Im not disappointed.",4
1218700,2022 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Just so you know, I guess in fine print somewhere you cannot return this item for $40, wasted money",1

669268,2018 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Growing mold already thats hard to clean.,1
723654,2020 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Had this product for a month and it already stopped working. The hummidifer was always hard to control and you never knew if it was gonna produce steam with or without salt.,1
1253710,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Ive used several different humidifiers and this one by far is the best. This is my second one. My last one lasted for about 8 years. I have a large living dining and kitchen area and it covers it all.,5
1190437,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I like that it is easy to use, cleans and purifies my humidifier, makes me feel relaxed that the water (which I add daily to the little bit that is left) is clean and purified.",5
968017,2020 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I use it everynight! I don`t have to fight to fill or clean it. Works great!,5
673487,2018 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I was so excited to receive my humidifier since its been so dry...2 days later and only using it a total of maybe 10 hours and the tank is cracked and water everywhere! I have contacted the manufacturer for a replacement but save yourself the hassle and go with something else.,1
672772,2018 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I have always had sinus issues. I used the regular sinus steam inhaler before. I prefer this one. I use to put the original inhaler on a tray and use a towel to cover my head. With this one, I can sit in my chair and use it, as it. It`s easy to set up and use. It`s great at alleviating the irritation and congestion I`ve been getting due to allergies. The instructions say you can use tap water, but I prefer distilled water.You can also use Vicks VapoPads for with it.",5
675291,2017 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This only has one Job, to evaporate water... it can`t even do that. Even if you `add salt as the instructions recommend it still does practically nothing. I purchased two hoping the first was a fluke, both were the same.",1
1244525,2022 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,really liked this product,5
1218746,2022 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Doesnt work for me.,1
924729,2020 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Works like a charm must get. Helps a lot of cold and cough and a nice night time sleep,5
668982,2019 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,It`s winter time now so we`ve been running this thing on a continuous basis for the last 3 weeks. Works like a charm. Easy to use and a simple reliable design.,5
951480,2020 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Vick`s vapor is too strong.,2
1104275,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,It is VERY dry where I live and I didn`t see the point of getting a super expensive humidifier like the one we have for a large room downstairs. This works perfectly in my 100+ sq ft office.,5
668392,2018 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Works fine,5
1124561,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This is a good steam humidifier. I have had three in the last 20 years. I wish cleaning and filling was easier. But I am so happy with the product otherwise. To clean I soak the heating element in vinegar to get crust off, scrub the tank as best I can with a long handle brush. I need a separate vessel to fill it as it won`t fit under the bathroom faucet. Other units have proven just as annoying in various ways without providing as good and reliable source of steam.",5

928875,2020 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Since I don`t have much things to do during this quarantine, I decided to write reviews that I purchased before. I hope companies will like seeing their 5 star review and help them when things get back to normal. Before flu season comes, I wanted to get a humidifier for our bedroom. we were not looking for a fancy one, just a simple and easy to start off. (We just moved to town so we already had a lot of things to buy) This is pretty simple humidifier. The sound is not that bad. If you are the lowest mode (they have two modes, weak and strong i believe), I can sleep through. It last the whole night like 7 hours and still remain a half tank. Easy to refill the water. A little hard to clean but its ok. I recommend cleaning this pretty often. U dont want to breath in dusty humidified air. Its very affordable price too. Stay strong VICKS :)",5
1074393,2020 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,DONT BUY this item. It smells so plasticky and I don`t think that steam is good to breathe in. And I didn`t realize this item is NOT returnable. I am yet to reach out to Amazon customer service,1

667615,2018 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Love this little thing! The filters get annoying, but we run softened tap and it stays clean and germ free for the past 2 years! It was perfect for our 2 bedroom apt but now that we have a 2100sq ft home, believe it or not - it does perfect. You fill it 1 per 2 days on level 1, and daily on level 2, 3. But it filters the air as well as humidifies and entire level of a home easily. There is also a spot to put Vicks Pads for when youre sick. I bet you could add essential oils here too with same pad once done. Happy homes!",5

I purchases on Amazon often so I just wanted to see what they had to offer. I was surprised at all the negative reviews and I wanted to address a few. @g3heavenlyfruit, Lou Zumek and Teresita Cruz, not enough steam?? Half the negative reviews are about it burning your hands and face! No, this is not suitable for young children; Ill give you that. There are vent holes PEOPLE so that the steam and your breath can escape. Blaming the steam inhaler for YOU(Nguyen Ngtam, GringoBob, Babsbuys) tipping it and burning yourself is like blaming a gun for shooting someone...we wont go there. Im fighting a respiratory infection(that will remain nameless) and Ive been THANKING GOD FOR THIS THING EVERY DAY! I had two humidifiers that were damaged when I needed them the most so I had a friend pick up this little guy at CVS. I think I paid $40 for it, but Id pay $400 after seeing the undeniable benefits! When youre rocking a 94% on the pulse oximeter and a 15 minute session brings you back to 98%, Id say it was well worth the money, dont you? Or you could go to the hospital and pay thousands of dollars to be on a ventilator. Your choice. Ive got it set up as shown by my bed so I can access it quickly, easily and comfortably. Turn it on, put in a few drops of Eucalyptus oil(when it gets hot, its not magic) and away I go! Thanks Vicks! Spot on.",5

1149696,2021 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,We liked the humidifiers noise level but we cant use it at night. Somebody had the stupid idea that the humidifier needed insanely bright blue lights on the power knobs. Even covering it with tape doesnt help. The light is so bright it throws multiple shadows. Its worthless to us and we have to find a replacement that can actually be used at night.,1

1114047,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I have had this product since my daughter was born: that was seven years ago and I`ve had no problems. I bought a new one because my daughter wants &quot;a pink one&quot; and so far I have no problem.,5
669656,2019 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I have only ever used a cool mist humidifier so this is my first warm mister and I have to say that while I like it, it does come lower than the cool mist variety. Setup and use is simplicity itself. I was confused by it not immediately deploying mist but the manual states it needs a few minutes to warm up, which makes sense. You will not see actual mist but once it starts going--at a mostly quiet volume level--you can feel the heat if you hover your hand over the spout.It seems cleaner to use than the cool misters which usually start accumulating crud everywhere. This is a definite plus. There are two levels, the higher to get the humidity level in the room to a reasonable level (if I remember right, the manual states it`s around 70%) and the lower is to keep it steady at that. I don`t have a hygrometer in my room so I let the high level run for about 30 minutes and then lower it. The main drawback to this humidifier is that it noticeably raises the temperature in my room and as I like to sleep in a cooler room, this is slightly unwelcome.I also don`t like the light on the level setting switch that is a bright light green. I have put some tape on it to ensure I have as near total darkness in the room. There are coupons for various Vicks vaporizing oils that can be poured into a receptacle on the humidifier and these are supposed to help clear sinuses during sleep. I don`t know if I`m interested in doing that, but for a complete test I should. A &quot;scent&quot; pad sample was included in the package and for about 24 hours, it kept the room fragrant with a minty smell. I couldn`t tell that it did anything for my breathing, however.So does it work? I don`t rightly know. I`ve slept with it going and without and so far, I can`t really tell there`s a difference. Cleanup is much easier, as I`ve said before, and that raises this to a 3.5 star review.",4
676670,2017 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This works well. The air is dry in our house when the heat is on so this definitely helps. I haven`t had any issues using it but it is an electric product that uses water so I am very careful with cleaning and filling.,5
1254405,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I had this model previously & it worked fine for about a year. This new vicks humidifier is only a month old and has not really worked correctly since it arrived. It barely creates steam, and stops after the water line drops an inch. Adding a little salt does not improve it. Adding a little more and it suddenly spews water everywhere. I run this every night as our home is dry in the winter, and it runs next to my bed. My sinuses are dry every morning, with absolutely no improvement. Most nights the water line doesnt budge. Just get a more expensive humidifier. I regret wasting money on this.",1

670489,2019 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Like this a lot. The only thing that keeps it from 5 stars is it needs to have a slight tilt and the display causes a reflection that makes it a little hard to read.,4

672589,2017 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This is definitely different from my other steam inhaler in that the steam is warm and very faint, and it takes a while (several minutes) for it to begin emitting steam. My other steam inhalerVanker Handheld Steam Inhaler / Steam Vaporizer / Personal Steam Inhaler - Upgraded Versionimmediately begins emitting a white, thick but wispy steam trail and has done a very good job for me. However, I realize this is a hot steam from the Vicks, which would take more time to produce, whereas my other steamer is a cold vapor mist. My whole family has tried out the Vicks Personal Sinus Steam Inhaler and they love it, but for now, I just like it. I wanted more steam, and less time to wait for it, but it does a good job. I put the little Vicks vapor pad in it and my daughter who has chronic sinus problems could breathe through her nose much better after just a minute or so of using it. I really like that the cord is permanently attached to the base because I`m always losing the power adapter to my other inhaler. The included instructions are very well written in English, French and Spanish. I think we will be using this sinus steam inhaler a lot this winter season and it`s so good to have two in the house instead of just the one.",4

1141930,2021 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I`ve had ongoing bad allergies, bronchitis, & asthma the last few years. I`ve tried almost everything to help tame throat irritation, cough, & other symptoms. I bought this to give it a try. I`m so glad I did. It`s very easy to use and works great. Simply twist top off and add water. You can add Vicks vapopads to the little slot in the back if you want. Plug machine in and turn it on. In a few minutes you will see steam begin to rise out of the machine. Place your face over it and alternate between breathing thru your nose and mouth for 5-15 minutes. It gives you plenty of steam. You can adjust a little lever on it to provide more or less steam. Two of the pictures I posted show the lever open and partially closed. What an amazing help this product has been. It quells sore throat, cough, & other symptoms down to almost nothing. My worst time has been morning and evenings. The aid of this device with vapopads has meant much less coughing, being able to clear out my lungs, breathing better, ease of sore throat, & better sleep. I saw one review saying there was not enough steam. I`m not sure what they are talking about because if there were more it might be a danger and burn your skin. This has just enough to not be dangerous and can be adjusted. The vapopads make a big difference and south irritation quickly. One vapopad can be used for 2 days. I used one pad morning, afternoon, & evening for each of 2 days and it worked great. The steam helps a lot by itself but with the vapopads it soothes so much better. I woke up today with a really bad cough and sore throat. 5 mins with the steamer and vapopad and I found myself clearing my throat a couple times and my cough was almost completely gone & my sore throat was soothed. I would highly recommend this product. Supervise little ones with it of course. I am a Mom and think this would work great with kids. Hope this review helps someone. The vapopads are not an exact fit. It`s okay to push them into the slot anyway. It hurts nothing and works great. You can see in one of the photos the slot & vapopad. Clean up was simple. Empty water and let sit to dry.",5
675100,2018 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I purchased this for my sons nursery. I had to lay a towel down it does say on the box not to be used on carpet.

668614,2019 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I like the product. However there is a safety issue that should be fixed. It wont shutoff when its out of water which can be a fire hazard. On more than one occasion I walked away from it while it was heating up only to forget about it. FYI,4

I was in my recording booth, struggling to get through what I need to, so I took a break and plugged this baby in. Ten minutes later, my voice was good as new! It was seriously incredible. I`ve tried a host of different things to help with my voice getting crackly or tired, including many products specifically targeted at voice performers, but nothing worked like this did!

You can hear a gurgle or the sound of water dripping from time to time but don`t worry it`s not leaking.I put a gallon of distilled water in and at 3/4 level for 8hrs a night it will last 3-4 days. It also has auto-shutoff so don`t worry about running out of water.I have had no issues with mold or pink residue others have mentioned. After more than a month of daily use the water and container are crystal clear.Filling it with water it a bit odd. The fill hole is in the bottom of the water tank so you have to take the tank off and turn it upside down. It does not have a flat surface on top so it wobbles and it is top heavy since it`s now an upside down pyramid. It`s not a big deal but you just have to make sure you hold it steady as you pour.",5

Had my previous humidifier for a decade and this new one is just a major disappointment. They really dont make things like they used to! Returning to the company and getting a different model ASAP.

It is working wonders at helping her get over her sickness and dry nose. It is bigger than I thought and can usually go 2 nights without refilling it.

675126,2017 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This product arrived with broken plastic and the water leaks every night. I would like a return on this but it saying it is ineligible for return however I am under the 30 days. This product is damaged! Buyers beware!!,1
677099,2017 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,love it,5
1085323,2020 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Needed to get an extra humidifier and saw the reviews and prices...so I decided to get it. The price is good, small but right for the living room or bedroom. I was concerned on the mist. So I put a towel under it to see if water got on the floor. (It doesn`t but still have it there just in case.) I also, just purchased, the &quot;protec cleaning ball&quot;...haven`t used it yet but I will have to clean the humidifier in a few days and then I will put it to see if that helps on keeping it clean. (I will do a review on that later.) I also haven used it with the Vapopads. So if you are looking for a affordable, small-does the job humidifier then I would definitely recommend this.",5
1046706,2020 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Before buying this one I bought another brand after a lot of research, which ended up just wetting everything around it when I turned it on. This on the other hand works perfectly. I keep it in nightside table and works perfectly.",5
673135,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Great price and so easy to clean. Does not need filter,5
678049,2017 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Very easy to operate. I`ve used distilled water only but I didn`t see that the instructions suggest that.,4
1111989,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,A little to strong for me. Moved farther away and didnt do much to help. Didnt last as long as was said. Tried different scents. I would not buy again.,3
1033331,2020 / 08,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I have a hot air vicks humidifier and i add this to the cup when I am sick. I have no idea if it actually helps (since tend to also take medicine when I am sick) but it for sure smells and feels soothing and helps me relax and go to sleep.,5
672348,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,If I could give this zero I would. Bought in Nov and last week the bottom screw cap broke right off. Worked well until then. It shouldnt break that fast.,1
678402,2017 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,4th one...the best warm mist out there.,5
1206665,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,If you have allergies you need this! Cleared me up and I was able to sleep!,5
1189668,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I am returning this product because it was defective. It would not steam or heat the water up.,1
669940,2019 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This is just ok. The refill pads are pricey and the scent only lasts for less than 4 hours.,2
1126271,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I like this product because it`s cheap and it is very easy to use and it lasts up to 1 month and it does the work itself to clean the humidifier,5

667830,2018 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This has helped out tremendously during the winter season. I purchased it because it was getting too dry in my house and sleeping was not comfortable.,5
1164729,2021 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"First product review ever. We bought this humidifier for our nursery. Had it for about 2 months or so without incident. Used distilled water and cleaned it regularly. It was quiet, easy, and did its job.Then out of nowhere, this thing started leaking like crazy. I took it apart, made sure it was clean, and nothing seemed to be wrong with it. I reset it and it was fine for a day or two. Overnight it leaked everywhere again, ruining the furniture it was placed on (we used a waterproof mat but to no avail). I turned it on just to watch was happening and the water was coming out of the dial.Of course, my return window was closed by this time. Theres no reason a $50 humidifier that has been taken care of should only last 2 months. Maybe mine was a fluke, but Ill avoid this brand for this type of product in the future.",1
1229724,2022 / 07,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,A staple in my home the moment we have a sickness we use Vicks in our humidifier.,5
672674,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Did not opt for out of box. It appeared to be out of box. Must have been, because it didn`t work. If it worked the device seems easy to manage with water. Wish I could use this as I bought this as I need a humidifier as I`m sick. Disenchanted.",1
677749,2017 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"If the lowest tap could be even lower vaporization, that will be perfect.",4
1201252,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Great product for sleeping, as soon as you connect it in minutes you will fall asleep.",5
1253956,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,With a pinch of salt we had a peaceful night. My kids were both very congested and with or without the Vicks sticks it made them sleep so much easier. Nice to have in the winter months with colds strike,5
1255486,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Does it even have an off switch,1
1230385,2022 / 07,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This item is a complete waste of money. And be aware, it is not returnable. I set it up and placed it beside the bed. The only way you can smell the vicks is to stick your nose directly on it.Amazon is gracious enough to send another one and a if I get different results from it I will update. But I don`t see this happening!!",1
677360,2017 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,It works great. Lots of steam to start with and as the water level lowers it produces less steam which I think is great so not to put to much humidity in the house. Easy to clean and fill. I use mine with eucalyptus oil for my yorkie that has congestion issues and it sure does help him.,5
1160904,2021 / 08,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Does not work in medium to large rooms. May work in same restroom or closet spaces,1
1245753,2022 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"In the winter, I have a problem with nosebleeds from dry, heated air, so I have to use humidifiers in the house all winter long. This product works exactly as described and keep the humidifier clean for long periods. The size is easy to insert in water tank for the type of humidifiers that I have but will not fit in the small openings of the cheaper humidifiers. Just check the opening size of the water tank for your humidifier before purchasing to ensure the fish will fit in the tank. I like that this does not contain nasty chemicals so it`s worry free. You definitely need to change your water daily though because nothing will prevent mold if you just leave the water in the tank for long periods without changing it. Love this product and I have been purchasing it for years now!",5
966504,2020 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I don`t know what this thing actually does it has no type of fan you insert the strips and adjust but you`d be better off just leaving the strips taped to the wall this thing does absolutely nothing. I thought it would enhance the scent and it did not at all - if you`re looking for an enhancement of the Vicks smell throughout your space I would recommend the Vicks Humidifier,1
1101983,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Really irritating that it cant be filled in my sink!,2
1105994,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,doesn`t mist just blows out cool air,2
1147022,2021 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I suffer from sinus infections and this steam inhaler helps a lot with decongesting. You have to give it about 6 minutes for the steam to start. I love that I can hold it when Im in bed or watching TV unlike other steamers that you have to sit by a table. The Vicks pads also are a nice touch to add. 100% recommend it.,5
678578,2017 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,works,4
1251758,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,It was a great humidifier at first. We only used it occasionally for colds. Just over 1 month of purchasing it started leaking from the dial that you set the level of humidity desired. Unfortunately this was 3 days out from the Amazon return window.,1
1202048,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"The light turned on. The water got a little warm, but not a drop got put into the air of my bedroom.",1

1135802,2021 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"doesn`t seem to last long, I put a little salt in mine for more steam but it comes out pretty hot so don`t have kids around it. it`s a great quick fix",3
669695,2019 / 07,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I have chronic sinusitis and need the moisture. I love that I can add a drop of essential oil to filter!,5
1071445,2020 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This works great and it keeps the room comfortable all night. I run it all day too for my little Yorkie who has allergy eyes like me,5
674812,2018 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Cheap overpriced piece of crap do not buy this go buy a kettle or a Vicks steamer for half the price it only holds about an oz of water and is so flimsy it Felt like it wouldnt work more than once,1
1231234,2022 / 07,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This works great!,5
1128127,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Humidifiers are so helpful to my family in the winter when we are sick. This is my favorite brand of humidifier because they are durable and work well for a long time. I don`t have to worry about them leaking or breaking because they are made from heavy duty plastic.,5
1059296,2020 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I love this product easy to clean and does make a big difference over night for symptoms i just leave my door cracked so it dosent get to humid in my room with it .,5
670148,2019 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Smoked to many cigs on a night out on the town? Feel like youre gonna die of asthma! This is the thing u need while I drink your coconut water to replenish your h2o cells. Throw on a face mask while your at it and book youll feel refreshed af. I actually use now weekly cuz it feels so refreshing and to help myVoice with singing cuz ya know I do the thing ,5
1190992,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Using this hit steam humidifier really helps keep down static in the house. The humidity helps the house feel warmer as well. My plants are digging it too.A great, inexpensive way to add humidity to a room. I have one in my bedroom as well",5
1115161,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"this is great price. easy to clean. love the vapors. even with the salt, does not do a lot of steam so that can be good or bad. the night light is soothing too. pro tip - buy the vaporizing steam and/or the pads too...they make the room smell good and you breathe easier :)",5
1252116,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Loved this product but should last longer than 6 months.,1

668429,2018 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"We purchased this for our newborns nursery. We loved the idea of diffusing the Vicks scent pads if she happened to get sick, but we mostly needed the unit for regular humidifying. However, after only 3 nights of use, the motor started making a very loud rattling sound. It is not consistent and very loud, so we just stopped using it all together. We will be buying a different humidifier.",1
674157,2018 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I love this vaporizer, good product, great price.",5

669361,2019 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,use it in my Vicks humidifier,5
676487,2017 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I bought this to help deal with some bronchial problems that wouldn`t go away. It`s just barely OK - no help to me but may be to some. The water container is rather small so it doesn`t last terribly long; and you have to get close and personal, probably standing over a kitchen or bathroom counter. Also, the refill pads that will supposedly impregnate your steam with Vicks are pretty worthless.I wish I could find the sort of vaporizer my family had 50+ years ago, basically an electric teakettle with a spout on top and a clip inside the lid to hold a cotton ball smeared with Vicks.",2
672297,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Saw this and purchased and Ive had it going for 3 hours now and its a great little vaporizer. Its warm steam and simple to use. Bigger than I expected which is ok with me lol Cant wait to see how the first night goes with it running. Absolutely would recommend. UPDATE DAY 2 added a couple pinches of salt? And the steam production is even better!! Super thrilled with this product,5
671407,2018 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,It is great.,4

1135012,2021 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Used with Vicks Vapor Pads. Really helped my sinuses and throat this winter. Kept my room`s air moist.,5
952466,2020 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"The sent is fine, but it doesnt produce enough smell when you use it in the Vicks humidifier or steamer. But buying this on Amazon is cheaper than buying in person in super markets. Easier than putting essential oils in oil diffusers if you are bored person like me. Fast shipping tho. It only last 8 hrs per pad, so basically, one pad per day. ~ $30 bucks per month.",3
672771,2018 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,simply the best one,5
678586,2017 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Easy too clean,5
926964,2020 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Product is good the only problem you have to keep changing water every 3-5 hours,3
669845,2019 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Easy to fill. I love the fact that there is no filter to deal with.,5
1073179,2020 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Works great for the price. Occasionally makes weird gurgling sounds but other than that it runs fairly quiet and does a good job. Doesn`t cover a large area really well but works good for a single room / bedroom.,4
668081,2018 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Ordered this product with high hopes. Worked wonderful first couple of days of having it, could see the humidifier working like a champ. Then one night my son wakes me up saying hes hearing a chugging sound, I search his room after his pleas to look and find nothing till i notice there is no steam coming from the nozzle on top, and that is where i hear the chugging sound. I take the top off, turn it on and off to it still not working, only to give it a smack on top, the steam starts to come out again. Very displeased as this happened within 4 days of owning. We do run it every night, but not on high setting, and even if we did run it 24/7 on high I would expect a brand new item to hold out longer than five days. Going to try and clean the product to see if it`s just clogged, although I don`t see how, considering we don`t have hard water. Will update if cleaning it fixes the problem, if not then I shall be returning it promptly.UPDATE: after cleaning the humidifier and rereading the reasons why the humidifier might not work, I`ve come to the conclusion that it has to be on a very level surface and you have to make sure the humidifier tank is set on the base completely or it will not work. Pleased with my purchase, maintenance is simple, quiet while operating, and the vapo warmer is a plus.",4
1111633,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"The vicks pads are pointless, they are in the oddest location, no air passes through them, therefore rendering them useless. For a basic humidifier save your money and grab a cheap version at Walmart",2

We bought this to replace our last starry night Vicks humidifier which we absolutely loved and lasted 5 years, but after just 4 months its already started falling apart.

While they dont recommend adding any oils or Vicks liquid where the water goes I did find a way to make the smell a little more potent. I rubbed some Vicks on the inside of rubber face mask. It helped, make sure you wash it after each use. Maybe they can a provide Vicks liquid to use for it in the figure, or maybe come up with masks that have different smells that you can purchase.

I`ve had dogs and cats and even birds... they get excited when I have this on! I grew up with this and I wouldn`t have it any other way. GOOD SIDE: It`s Plastic and has Safety features. BAD SIDE: Being Plastic and if you use this frequently; even with well care - it has a life span of 2-3 years which means the unit will have to be replaced; especially true if you reside in extremely hard-water area.

670400,2019 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I bought this because I live in Michigan and it gets really cold and dry in winter, especially so with the central heating blasting throughout my house. This particular humidifier is great for several reasons. First and foremost, its super easy to use. Just twist off the cap at the bottom, throw some water in, re-cap, and set it in the base and its good to go. The Vicks vapor tab is super nice when you are sick or congested. It really makes it a lot easier to breathe. Its also really easy to clean because of the wide opening at the bottom. Ive even put it in the dishwasher with the heated drying setting off (it might make the plastic crack if you leave it on) and it works great. I usually sanitize the base area with a mixture of baking Soda and vinegar with an old toothbrush to get rid of any mildew buildup.",5

I tried cleaning with Dawn, soaking in vinegar, baking soda, alcohol,and left it outside in the sun to diminish the smell, believe me nothing worked. On top of all that, this product is NON RETURNABLE. Do yourself and your children a favor, do not buy this inhaler.

After that, it started to become louder while running and stopped producing the steam... I only put distilled water in it, cleaned it regularly and dumped the water out every evening as the water was always really dark with pieces of what looked like metal (maybe from the filter?). I would not recommend personally.",2
1072775,2020 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video. I got this vaporizer to replace one I`ve had for over 20 years. My other Vicks vaporizer was nothing more than a giant tub with a couple of electro tubes centered inside a cylinder. The old one worked fine and although it turned the water sediments into hard crusty calcifications at the bottom of the tank (it was not too hard to clean). It required distilled or purified water. However, the electrodes over time begin to get so coated that no matter what I did I couldn`t get the calcification off. So I decided to buy a new one and this new modern model was it.The tank has a nice sleek upright design and holds plenty of water. See photo and video upload. When the bottom tamk needs to be cleaned, you will notice a off-colored calcification or sediment. That`s normal and that is coming from the water itself. It is not mold! I think people in some of the reviews are not familiar with the way these tanks work and have often given them bad reviews because they don`t understand what it is they`re seeing when it`s time to clean out the tank. Of course the tanks need to be cleaned out once a week to make sure no bad mold or germs gets in them. It`s not the design fault if people do not keep it clean like they`re supposed to.Anyway it`s very quiet the only thing you can hear is occasional faint rippling sound as the water bubbles below in the lower tank. You really can`t hear it unless you`re up close.The humidity adjustment switch is extremely sensitive. All the way open and your humidifier looks like a steam train. You can adjust the intensity and how much vapor comes out by a handy knob (which my other vaporizer never had). You can get very little or a lot by the eaay-turn knob.There is a side door to put a vaporizer pad if you needed it. We don`t need it. We just need the moisture in the air from being in a dry climate.Where to put the vaporizer: The idea is to put it in a place where the vapor cannot negative impact wood floors or furnishings. I have it on a folded beach towel on my wood floors several feet away from a bookcase. In the bedroom we just sit it on the towel on the dresser. No problems with oversaturation because we can adjust the knob as needed.I got it on Amazon when it went on a discount! Couldn`t beat the price or pass up the deal. As far as its function goes I give it five stars!So far so good! if there`s anything less than a five-star out of this product, I will certainly update my review.",5
1074106,2020 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"no noise. easy to use,works great and a nightmare to clean. unless you have no bones in your wrist. Im really confused as to why they would make it so hard to clean? especially as it needs to be cleaned weekly.",4

Just like the other poor reviews I just noticed, I`m getting the same thing, already tried per their instructions that came with the product, adding salt two times, and still hardly no steam. It`s not working like it should. Years ago, I had a vicks vaporizer that worked so great, and put out alot of steam like it`s suppose to, and all night long. Never had any trouble with it, and it lasted quite a few years, and used it alot. Now today I go to buy a vaporizer at Walmart, and I seen they have changed the model of their vicks vaporizer. This is the model (that is on this web page). Apparently, they shouldn`t have touched it (shouldn`t have done all these changes to the model), because this one is of very poor quality and has problems working. This one is just making crackling, boiling type noises with no steam coming out. And it`s brand new! I do not recommend buying this product. And they should go back to the other model, the one which has the wider and a bit flatter type bowl, and make the steamer unit like it was with that previous model that had that kind of bowl.",1

I`ve been using this humidifier in my daughter`s room for the last few weeks and I have been pleased with its performance. It is a cool mist humidifier, so you don`t have to worry about hot liquids or Steam potentially causing injury.It is very easy to use. Simply fill up the tank with water, screw on the lid, and place it back on the unit. You can adjust the setting on the front of the unit. I have found that when I place the humidity level in the middle it usually has more than enough water to last all night long.A neat feature also included with this humidifier is the slideshow that is projected on the ceiling. You can choose between jungle animals, sea creatures, and stars. It will automatically cycle between 3 images in the category that you`ve selected. My daughter really enjoyed looking at the images projected on the ceiling.There is also a place where you can insert a Vicks pod if you need to add a little extra support for congestion or coughs. One pod is included with the humidifier.If you live in an area with hard water I would recommend using distilled water in order to help avoid some of the hard water buildup on the filter and on the unit.",5

1243773,2022 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Produces VERY Cool Mist. You Will Need A LOT Of Filters Used 3 Nights (Not In A Row) Before Filter Molded. There Was No Smell Or Indication Of It,3
1207680,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Wife loves it. Was really good price. It is a little loud but we like to think of it as a noise machine for my kids,5
677085,2017 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Some of the complaints on this product are nonsense. No leaks, if correctly put in the tank. Works great. Does it`s job for our grandsons stuffy noses.",5
1111394,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I like steam netter than cool mist because it adds a bit more heat as well as moisture in the air.,5
1019134,2020 / 07,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Im sure these are great but if you have animals these are not good for them. I wish they would put a disclaimer relating to animals as most people have them. Menthol and eucalyptus are especially harmful. Even worse for dogs particularly. It can cause seizures. Also make sure they are compatible with your unit. they were not for mine and amazon advertised for me to buy them with the humidifier that I purchased :( Im hoping I can repurpose them some other way that is still safe for my dog.,3
665373,2019 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Product stopped working 7 months after buying it. Only used it on 5 separate occasions.,1
1114871,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Previously, I wrote a review stating &quot;everything matches to what is described in Amazon website&quot;.After using it for a few of days, I noticed that it`s not really quiet. Noise is not coming from motor,but from water. This noise can be annoying to some people, and maybe not for others,so I changed star rating to 4 from 5.",4
667780,2019 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,The only problem I have had is that the plug seemed to be a strange size and would not plug into any outlet in the room where I wanted it. I ended up having to plug it into an extension cord. It runs quietly and has been dependable. Great value and very happy it does not require filters.,4
671372,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Actually, very nice little humidifier! My favorite part about it is theres a small light around the dial which is typically green, however turns red when you need to fill with water! Definitely needs cleaned about once a week, and it makes a small hissing noise (not very noticeable at all, however I have very sensitive hearing) but overall is great!",4
678161,2017 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I used this Vaposteam with my son`s Vicks humidifier. He has an asthmatic cough that flares in the winter, and I purchased this in the hopes it would help. If you add a bit of salt with the Vaposteam in the water it really gets the mist flowing. The mist + a few propped up pillows and it is the ONLY thing that helps my son breathe at night and keeps his cough away and his airway clear. Highly recommend.",5
673154,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Don`t waste your money. Half fill the base with hot tap water (not boiling)? Get more steam from a bowl of chicken soup or a cup of tea! I will say the VapoPads that come with it have a strong Menthol smell, but I was looking for Steam Therapy.",1
1181379,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I absolutely loved this humidifier. It is so quiet and you can adjust to any setting with the dial BUT less than a year after I bought it when I pulled it out to use it wouldnt turn on. Im very disappointed because now it doesnt work at all. ,3
968543,2020 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I love the smell so calming,5
669891,2019 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Wickless and filter free, this is a great option. Space friendly as well - about the size of a volleyball. Has a great mist output and has an option to use those Vicks relief packs.",5
671391,2017 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,It works very well...but very noisy...every 5 sec you get a burst of bubbling steam. It will get on your nerves awake and sleeping was hard.,2
677208,2017 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Works great.,5
929144,2020 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This is a must to keep the water clean and not smelling horrible. It works like clockwork and does last a month.,5
927209,2020 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I`ve had it for a few months now, and it still works fine. The only problem is, that, as a 120-lb woman, I find it a little bit heavy and hard to set up when full.",4
677714,2017 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I was a bit apprehensive on purchasing another Vicks humidifier (bought another model and was pure crap. The damn thing would spit out water all over everywhere) This one is working perfectly and it is SO quiet! I am a light sleeper and I can hardly tell this is on! Very happy so far, just hope I havent jinxed myself by writing this only a week after I received it.",5
665384,2020 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Doesnt work! As you can tell by pictures it will not blow the mist. ,1
1214424,2022 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,The humidity does not really do the job. It is doing too little with the mist. For 8 hours only 1 degree for went up from a 596 square foot living room? This machine does very poor in humidification I will return it I think this a return and rebuilt of what I got Katz business.,1
1251847,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,No complaints,5
671904,2018 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Son absolutely Loves his `rocket`. Mommies don`t love how hard it is to clean out or empty all the water. The projected humid air is absolutely fridged.,3
1245629,2022 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Just the size I wanted for a small bedroom with the added feature of Vick`s products to aide in sinus and congestion problems.,5
1128919,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,So much easier to fill than most! Just wish it held more water. A solid buy.,4

1071902,2020 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I am well pleased with this product. Works great. Product arrived a couple days sooner than originally scheduled.,4
1103876,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Mist is very low barely smell the vicks, otherwise its nice n small, i wish it would work better.",2
1201004,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"not worth the money,",1
931335,2020 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I dont dislike anything about this! Well made, quiet, easy to clean and refill, and great customer service!",5
671561,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"For $15, it is efficient and does its job. It definitely creates a warm mist in the air and has helped my son with his allergies and breathing troubles. Pros: cost efficient, creates warm mist, easy to fill, holds a lot of water, easy to clean. Can also use the vapo pads with it. Cons: leaves behind weird grey crystals, MUST add salt for it to work, MUST be all the way full to work its best. The noise doesnt bother any of us and I dont mind rinsing out the crystals but why, Vicks? I would recommend the humidifier if youre on a budget or looking for an inexpensive but effective one. I imagine it would do well in a large room even. If you have an extra $15 to blow, spend $30 and grab the warm, adjustable mist by Vicks. Weve had that one for 10 years or better and its still going strong. Either way, I dont think you can go wrong with the brand name. Four stars for the crazy, grey, mysterious crystals left behind that is simple a nuisance.",4
1059450,2020 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Helps me breathe better.. with this humidifier, I don`t need cold and flu medicine because this clears all my symptoms and helps me get a good night`s sleep as if I`m not sick at all.",5
673095,2018 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I use it for my kids during the cold/flu season and it works great. The plus for me was twofold, one with the VapoRub filter and two with the power button that doubles as a nightlight.",5
982694,2020 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I like that it help me out,5
672146,2018 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,A great addition to the humidifier. It definitely soothes congestion and sore throats during the night time hours. I greatly recommend for children. (Please note....this is to be used as an additive to the water In the humidifier. Not to be taken by mouth!),5
1200270,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Worked great until it didnt. Worked maybe one month! I want a refund! Dont waste your money.,1
676042,2017 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I should`ve done this a long time ago what a difference it makes.,5
674485,2018 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Very nice product with low maintenance.,5
672545,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Love that the fill hole is big enough for me to get my hand in for cleaning. I recommend using vinegar over the bleach they tell you to use. Add a bit of vinegar to the water periodically and you won`t get mildew. I also use filtered water so scale isn`t a problem. I lve the 30 hour run time.,5
1206330,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Works well. Even when you clean it and flip the filter properly, running it everyday the filter lasted us a month. Wish best buy sold the filters as well, but had to go on amazon for replacements.",5
668604,2019 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This Ultrasonic Humidifier produces considerable water vapor. Just wish it had a larger reservoir that was easier to refill.,4
677816,2017 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Its pretty good. I use it for my sulfate tortoise over winter when its too dry and cold at night. I wish it gave off more humidity towards her. Its usually just in one spot. Im order for me to do so I would have to place it in her box which I could do but for safety reasons and I dont want it to get dirty I wont do that. So far it hasnt broke or i havent had any problems besides that. Ive had it for about two weeks now. You definitely get what you pay for.,3
671438,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This humidifier is SO easy to use! We have three in different rooms in the house, since our air is so dry. We received it in a couple of days from order. Very pleased.",5

1072495,2020 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Definitely worth the money!! Im dealing with a cold right now and this clears up my sinuses so fast! A must have in your medicine cabinet!,5
673129,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Loudest humidifier I have ever had and I have had alot of humidifiers. DON NOT PURCHASE.,1
672863,2018 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I was anxious to use the humidifier, I read directions, then took the top off to fill with distilled water, but I was unable to get the stopper out, after trying for a long time, I decided to return the item, I was afraid to try to force it with plyers, for fear of breaking the plastic. Never got to use it.",4
677091,2017 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Easy to use and easy to refill the water tank, gives off a decent amount of warm mist for an average size room. Everything comes apart in a fairly logical manner for cleaning and it will need regular cleaning, I have city water but there was still a lot of scale built up after two weeks of use, they recommend cleaning all the interior parts with vinegar and you will need an old toothbrush, you can use the same toothbrush that you are brushing your teeth with tomorrow morning, I mean who am I to judge? Works good, probable goes for 8 hours on a tank of water.",5
677920,2017 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Just the correct amount of noise. Helps me sleep wo/being too noisy. However; the replacement pads (That do not have the Vicks name) are not the same as the OEM one. They dry-out at the top, quicker than the OEM one. They also create a mess with the metal support dissolving. Called VICKS and that`s what you get. Not sure if I`d purchase it again. Oh BTW, (according to cust support) this unit is NOT made by VICKS.",4
670570,2019 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Humidifier started making a loud noise after 2 weeks of use...I have 2 of these exact same make & model...1 works great ...the other noise ,2
677829,2017 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"The best vaporizer I`ve ever owned. Easy to use and clean, and one tank lasts me all night for a great sleep!",5
669720,2019 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This can leak out the bottom! It has no plug for it to stop leaking when the filter area overflows.,3
668177,2018 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I have loved Vicks products but this one piece has given me problems. It does not run without adding salt. I thought overtime I will not need to add salt but I need to every single time of use,3
1115104,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I purchased this item and it doesn`t work. Amazon will not refund my money for the additional 2 filters that I purchased. Product is completely defective and does not work as advertised. Do not buy from this seller!!,1
1134781,2021 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Bought it and thought I was so happy with it. I was tired of having to clean the other kind from mildew grow I couldnt reach but thought the filter on this one would help. Although I never saw moisture, the level went down in the tank over night. Then a week after having it I noticed by chance the finger looked dirty. Removed it to mind it has mildewed a lot. Pictures included. They show MILDEW ONLY not dust or dirt. Thought these things kept mildew from growing! Junk and hard to find replacement filters that fit. The one I bought that was for sale right beside it doesnt fit.",1
677171,2017 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This humidifier is amazing. Would definitely recommend! We bought it for our room now that we have a new baby.,5
678404,2017 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This humidifier works exactly as I would hope. Its consistent, turns off after empty, and only needs to be refilled twice a day when used all day. Not bad! Its a great price for the value and cuts the dryness of my small 500sq ft apartment well. No complaints.",5
1254657,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I like this much better than the cool mist humidifiers. The reason for 4 stars only is that it must be cleaned to prevent `black crystals` from forming. We have high mineral well water so these crystals form & build up on the heading elements. Once a month I have to take the top apart, soak it in vinegar, scrub with an old toothbrush, rinse, replace. It`s like cleaning (de-scaling) your coffee pot.",4
677285,2017 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I am noticing that if we turn the machine on too high. Then the room would look foggy. So we have to almost barely turn the dial on.,4
670601,2019 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This Vicks VWM845 Warm Mist Humidifier is probably the best humidifier I have used. It is extremely easy to set up, with just filling the large water tank, replacing it in the unit, and rotating the dial to the lower or higher ON setting. the water tank fits upside down in my bathroom sink so is easy to fill directly from the faucet. This works great on the low setting in our household, and the warm extra humidity helps us all breath more easily. Recently, my daughter had a bad flu, and keeping this on throughout the day really helped.There is an easy to access cup area (blue colored on top) in the vent zone where the steam comes out, that you can add essential oils to. You are not supposed to add oils to the water directly in the tank or otherwise, as this will void the warranty. Vicks also provided a vapor tab sample that you can place in a designated slot on the side of the machine, which does about the same thing as adding oils in the cup, but is neater. Overall, this is a great little machine that is super quiet and works very well.",5
670198,2019 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Really helps my son sleep at night when he is stuffy,5
1200400,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I love the various options for adding Vicks products like scent filters or liquids. Machine is very efficient requiring less filling. Setting humidity level is very convenient..very low to high and everything in between.,5
676241,2017 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Fast shipping and does what it suppose to do. Even better when you use the vicks liquid.,5
673140,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This worked great for about a month and a half then it suddenly stopped working. In my mind thats not a good product if it barely lasts. Also while it worked well and I did like the vapo option, it was difficult to fill.",1
1181108,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This is a real nice unit, BUT you must use distilled water in it. I used my city water instead, which is good quality water, but it apparently has minerals in it, so after 3 days of running this humidifier, I had WHITE DUST all over my living room, even coating the window! It is the minerals in the water that causes the white dust, which is a tacky white coating on things. I will not be buying distilled water, so I returned this humidifier. Other than that problem, this is a real nice humidifier. I wish I could have kept it.",3
665072,2020 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,nice humidifier,5
669089,2019 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,The warm mist is great in cooler rooms and I love the recepticle for essential oils!! Product came as described and securely packaged!! Highly recommend it for adding moisture especially in colder areas!!!I would definitely order from this seller again!! Thank you,5
678052,2017 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Easy to fill. Hard and complicated to clean.,4

1200760,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This product took a very long time to arrive, but when it finally did, I loved it! It was quiet and easy to clean, and , best of all, it worked in terms of keeping the bedroom humidity at a level that was god for our eyes, which get especially dry in the winter. Then, yesterday, after less than six months, if just stopped working. The orange light comes on, but nothing else happens. Unfortunately, I had already bought the identical product again, and have missed the window to return it. I would advise against buying this product, unless you are only using it occasionally, in which case it might be a feasible option.",1
1180354,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Not a great product. Not worth the price for sure.,1
669980,2019 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Products works as advertised. Inexpensive. Smaller than the one I purchased at Walmart for the same price but does the job.,5
670054,2019 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Loved it! Lasts all night long.,5
673692,2018 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Absolutely perfect.,5
671809,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I really like the cool mist. Also, I love that I can use one, or two, vapor pads. Being able to adjust the amount of humidity is awesome. This is a great unit!",5

668145,2019 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"We bought 2 and only opened 1 to try. This product is only good if your trying to put cold air into your house or room. It has a filter that absorbs the water and pulls air in through the filter and out. It works as a swamp cooler would work really, however it is not putting any humidity or moisture into the air. Very disappointing. Says cool mist there is no mist. Also only used 2 days filter already molding",1
1208337,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I`ve had many vaporizers over the years, this one from Vicks is the best cool mist to date. Easy to adjust, reasonably easy to clean and fill. No complaints.",5

1112376,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This did just the opposite... I had a terrible mold buildup just after a couple months of use when before I used this I never had a mold problem. I`ve had my humidifier for many years and never had a mild problem.,1

664055,2019 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Bought from a local store on my way home this afternoon from work. My 16 month old has a stuffy nose and fever :( After asking advice from my pharmacy friends at work i decided to give this a try. Filled it with filtered water from my fridge. It came with two vapor pads so i put those in and turned it on for an hour. Really nice. Was rocking baby and i noticed how she was visibly getting relief- feeling better. Nice. Fast forward to night time and we have a busy house so i put some camphor in the reservoir in the top to kick it up a notch. Yall. My baby is sleeping peacefully despite having a fever and i can visibly hear her breathing easier, as we are still nursing. Love this machine: worth the buy.",5

676433,2017 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Its only OK. For price I will hold onto it - especially since I disagreed the box, and it does the job. My only complaint - a big one - is that you have to plug and unplug to turn on/off which is kind of ridiculous and annoying.",3
1128023,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Doesn`t look very pretty but works well. Only comes with one vicks pad (needs two) but definitely very strong. Steams well and easy to use. It does not look very good so don`t leave it out to decorate your room.,4
665230,2019 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Too much maintenance. Started mold growth in just 3 days. I even had a humidifier cleaning fish inside the tank. I had Crane humidifiers before that never built up any mold and I cleaned only once a week. Disappointed in Vicks. I am going to return this product.,1

1215375,2022 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This product seems to do a better job of humidifying than the evaporative type and its a big plus that you dont have to keep buying filters. It would be very expensive however, to fill these with distilled water. I use filtered water all the time, from a Brita pitcher, but the scale still builds up on the heating element over the course of 5 to 7 days which requires taking the humidifier apart and descaling it. After about 5 descaling cleanings, the scale doesnt come off as easily or as completely as it did at first. Also, you cannot dry the area with the heating element by hand. It is hard to reach into the crevices where the scale collects.",4

I will just about fall asleep and then it gulps rather loudly and it startles me and I`m awake again.The filter got little black specks on it right away. Is this mold? I don`t really know what to look for. They did not come off the filter after soaking.It is large so you definitely need to make space for it to have it close to your bedside.",4

Tonight my kids both have colds again, the almost 2 year old was up every 5 or so minutes for 4 hours. i finally grabbed the plug in and put 2 pads in, within 20 minutes he was finally able to sleep. i think i am going to buy some more while I`m thinking of it, because i am exhausted!",5

1032444,2020 / 08,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I`ve had good luck and bad luck with this model of humidifier. I`ve owned 3 of these. The first one worked great. After 2 years it stopped working and I had to get another. That one didn`t make any steam, and I knew from my first one that when working properly it will produce visible steam. I returned that and got a replacement, and the replacement works fine, I can see steam, but not as much as I did with my first unit. So I would say it is hit or miss. It`s a good value for the money, just note that if you don`t see the steam, you probably need to replace it. It`s easy enough to clean, but because of the shape of the top, when you dump water out you almost always have a quarter of a cup of water still in the bowl that just won`t come out. That hasn`t been a very big deal for me. We`ve had the unit filled with water and running all night and into the next day without running out of water. It`s not loud, but there`s a little noise and you can hear it running. Its good white noise for the kids to sleep through. There`s a spot to put those little Vicks pads (which are optional) if you want that menthol benefit. Those Vicks pads just sit on the outside part, probably so that the smell can diffuse easy through the room. But just watch because kids can easily pull those pads off of the unit if you have it on the floor or something.",3
1243593,2022 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I purchased this because I was always so stuffy during the night and always breathed through my mouth which then gives you dry mouth. I have a gauge which goes from about 43% humidity level at bedtime and rises to about 53% during the night. It has definitely helped the stuffiness (along with a decongestant). Haven`t had to clean it yet. I gave this a 3 star for noise because if you put it on high, it`s too noisy for me. Low is very acceptable. Therefore, so far so good. I make it through most nights breathing through my nose.",5

At first it was only when starting, but the eventually it started grinding in the middle of the night and literally scaring everyone awake! We reached out to Kaz but it was the beginning of the pandemic and impossible to get in touch with anyone. We bit the bullet and ordered a new one from Amazon, and it started doing the same thing within a few months. Unfortunately it was after Amazon`s return policy, and I still couldn`t get in touch with Kaz, so we just dealt with it. We stopped using it because it was such a pain, and now here we are in winter again, in dire need of a humidifier, and the sound just won`t stop. I think now we are past any warranty, so we basically spent $100 on junk that we had to through away.

It is absolutely enough vapor to keep the room humid enough during everyday use but I do prefer extra vapor for those days when my baby is stuffy and I want to help decongest him.

I took for granted all the benefits the humidity gave me: such as having to wear body lotion since it was built into the air! So winters here gave me peeling skin-- especially on my face, which was weird because I have quite oily skin. After trying a bunch of super thick and moisturizing moisturizers, I realized the cause was the dry air in my apartment due to the heater. I also experience an increased number of sinus headaches and migraines, which I realized was likely caused by the same thing.This humidifier has done wonders for me-- in the ~2 months I`ve had it, I`ve noticed that my face is much less dry and I`m having significantly fewer headaches/migraines. I use it on the low setting most evenings and can usually get 2 evenings` worth of uses out of each refill of water. The upkeep can be a little annoying, but it`s worth it.

It has most of the features I look for: - No filter - Size is compact - Water tank is large enough to last 24 hours before needing a refill - It is incredibly easy to fill. It has a flat top which sits nicely in the sink and a huge opening which makes filling easy. It also makes cleaning easy. - It`s quiet, which is nice if you are running it in a bedroom.The only thing missing is the ability to switch to a warm mist. However, the warm mist humidifiers that I have owned have all burned out after a year or two; the cool mist ones last longer.

I called the company and they sent a replacement , and guess what - exactly the same problem! Horrible burnt plastic / chemical smell.

The way that the water bottle attaches to the base is very poorly designed. It has a tendency to not sit flush against the back of base which then prevents it from seating properly on the bottom. It also leaks which seems quite dangerous. After using for a little while the red light would come on and the machine would stop working.

678001,2017 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This is the second one of these we have owned. You definitely need to clean the heating element. We were not very good about keeping up w/ this on our last one and it became crusted over w/ sediment from the water=not working.,4
1046805,2020 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,It works great. Holds more water than most,5
668834,2019 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Stopped working after 3 uses. I followed the directions of adding salt, waiting 10 minutes, adding more salt...waiting some more....nada.",1
1215150,2022 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,They don`t tell you a bunch of stuff will end up in your machine from the constant boiling water. Better just to get one of those ultrasound or something ones,1
676379,2017 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Do NOT buy this product. It leaks everwhere!!! I figured I would give it a try and was disappointed. It was convenient for it to have a night light and a humidifier but the water spills somehow. I don`t know why the water keeps spilling. This product deserves 0 stars!!!!! EXTREMELY DISSATISFIED,1
1188201,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Spray of good quality and for the health of young children,5
669794,2019 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,It holds a lot of water than my old humidifier - crane. It is easy to clean but I find it pretty noisy,2
672429,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I`ve had two of these in the last year. Switches don`t work properly, pink mold in areas that are not easily accessible in the tank and base.",1
678221,2017 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"excellent, works handy when i need it",5
676182,2017 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Can I use this with my newborn? I am trying to clear up a cough.,1
677748,2017 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I AM WARNING YOU!!!!!! This unit like many other reviews started making a loud noise every now and then when it was on. Early this morning our smoke alarm in our baby`s room went off and this unit was smoking - please note there was still half a tank of water in the unit so it was NOT due to it running out of water! It smelled like burned plastic and I am so grateful we had a smoke detector in it and plenty of water or God knows what could have happened. THIS IS A FIRE HAZARD AND SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE MARKET IMMEDIATELY.,1
678503,2017 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,for the money pretty good product,3
1060906,2020 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Stopped working on the second use and target wouldnt take it back or exchange it. Waste of $40,1
675703,2017 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This thing emits barely any steam whatsoever. And is somewhat noisy.,2
723957,2019 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Works well. Didnt have any issues with it.,4
929294,2020 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,It does not connect,1
668504,2019 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,used this humidifier 5-6 times and then the on/off knob quit turning. it is just stuck in one spot.,1
677055,2017 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"It is not the best quality, but for the money it`s just fine. It does it`s job well. I discovered I`ve been walking around for years with a sinus infection. So I am using this to steam clean my sinuses (2x/day) to get the funk out. It seems to be working as some funky ### indeed is being purged. My personal medical research seems to indicate that that pseudo-ephedrine and sinus spray to open and dry the nasal passages up and this to help loosen it up to expunge may just work over several months to end what I`ve had for years.",5
1160317,2021 / 08,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,you can get the same effect from just opening a jar of vapor rub and inhaling. this thing is a huge waste,1
671316,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Need more instructions on what exactly to use in it to really smell the vicks, maybe its the vicks satchell not strong enough I dont know but , it seems to work I guess",3
664071,2019 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Best humidifier i have owned,5
678114,2017 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Just what I was looking for, is hard to find in our area",5
1127671,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I bought this for my husband`s snoring. So far it`s helped tremendously with opening up his nasal passages. He`s sleeping much better and doesn`t wake up as often from snoring.,5
672176,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Horrible plastic smell when turned on.,1
672604,2018 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,It is not very effective. The steam is so minimal it isnt noticeable.,2
669501,2019 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I had pneumonia and this helped with my breathing so much. We liked using it while I was sick so much that now we still use it daily.,5
673826,2018 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,It is a piece of junk,1
1191231,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Some of them must have been really old because they had black mold inside the tabs and smelled awful. I had to throw half of them out. I thought buying in bulk would be better, but I ended up getting stung instead.",1
1071595,2020 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Bought this because a friend of mine used this on me when I stayed at her house & I had a stuffy nose. It worked great so I had to have one for myself.This little thing is amazing, I used mine because I had a cold & it kept me clear through the night. No cough, no stuffy nose, nada. I also purchased the lavender strips that fit this machine & what a wonder combing vicks with calming lavender. I slept through the night & woke up with a clear nose.Highly recommend for cold/flu season.",5
668686,2018 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This is our second Vicks Humidifier and they are great. We bought the first one for our room and this one for our daughter`s room. They are nice and quiet and we have had the first one for over 3 years.,5
664552,2019 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Its good and serves the purpose, although i have noticed that a sort of white plaque seems to form on the inside where the water would go..this could be lime but I have tried washing it by manafacturers standards (with white vinegar solution) from when i got it and this problem still persists. I`m not too sure how safe it is to be inhaling that stuff but in this poisonous world we live in, i`ll take my chances.",2
670915,2019 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Works wonderfully, have to add a little salt to get the vapor going but it really helped my 1 year old son with his chest cold.",5
1252030,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Lo uso casi a diario, padezco de sinositis y no puedo tomar casi medicamento y eso para m a sido una bendicin, cuando me siento congestionada me doy mi vapor dos a tres veces al da y mejoro a la vez le doy humedad a mi rostro, funciona super, calienta muy bien, tiene que tener cuidado no quemrce con el agua y muy sencillos de usar y tambin de limpiar.",5
1225489,2022 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Purchased this in April. It worked fine for about a month and then started leaking around the seam. At first it was just a drip but now it is pouring out. It is past the time for return and I cant find anywhere to ask company for a replacement.,1
1141688,2021 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,The best thing when you are congested,5
667738,2018 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"But mine hasn`t. Though I`ve followed all of the directions, I`ll get up in the middle of the night with it stopped and a red light on.I have to move the receptacle, check all the parts and either turn it off and wait or move it to another flat surface and then place the eater receptacle back in. Not what you want to do in the middle of the night. I`m very disappointed.",2
1142781,2021 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Even with the sample menthol tab and about 10 minutes using it, it didnt open my nasal passages that were affected by allergies. I tried to return it and it says this is not eligible for a return. Now Im stuck with a $40 useless piece of equipment.",1
664194,2019 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I bought this humidifier 30 April 2019 because of the high rating on Consumer Reports, but by mid- September it started making so much noise that it kept my son awake. I suspect a bad fan. Very disappointed. It has a 2 year warranty so I am going to try to get it replaced.",1
670892,2019 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Great in my vaporizer,5
673841,2018 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This product leaks like crazy after 6 months of use. This was a second product I used which eventually began to leak.,3
669638,2019 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I have used this little device several times in my life. I must have lost it in my move so I had my husband purchase a new one from Walmart tonight. I was about to put water in it and saw calcium scaling in the bottom. Its obviously been used and its disgusting to me that Walmart accepted that returned item and put it back on the shelf for another customer. Thats like putting a returned toothbrush back on the shelf. Who knows what the last person put in the machine. Gross! Walmart FAIL!,5
663861,2020 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Like itBut be crguelas when you lift it because water comes outIts very hard to understand how to refill the water and clean because there are many parts. But the product is working excellentBut there is light and I didnt want it to aulominate the roomStill a very good product!,5
670938,2019 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I needed an additional humidifier besides the 10 year old filter one I have. This got good reviews. However, if you have hard water you DO NOT want an ultrasonic humidifier! You will end up with a white residue all over everything. I only ran it as night and within 3 months it made a growling noise when I turned it on. At first I could turn it it off and on to stop it but after 2 weeks of doing that it made the noise all the time. I also read this in other reviews. I returned it for a refund and bought one with a filter and hope to get 10 years or more out of it.",1
673644,2018 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I have a separate cool mist humidifier, and wanted to try a warm mist humidifier to help my kids allergies and sniffles. After some uses I found that the water tank leaks, at the corner which is a product defect. Even with limited warranty, they won`t replace tank, and would cost another $15 +S&H to replace.I would recommend getting a different brand humidifier, as it seems that the Vicks/Kaz isn`t very good with their support.",1
670481,2019 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,No good. I never see it`s warm water before I bought it. It`s no good for summer. It`s not very easy to clean it up. I want to return back it but it looks like very dirty after I used once.,1
678795,2017 / 08,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,The fan is not very strong in the unit,2
1142050,2021 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Love this product. It has been a lifesaver!,5
1114888,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Easy to use. Sinus issues and great for this,5
674624,2018 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I only wish it had an auto shut off when dry,5
674722,2018 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Works well, ordered it for my mother and she loves it, helps a lot with her sleeping.",5
1254592,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,My husband loves this. His nose is always stuffed up and the steam is comforting. He likes the steam isn`t too intense or hot on his face and how it`s small and easy to use in his chair with a TV tray.,5
1062470,2020 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Does a great job at humidifing my room. The air feels fresh, and if you use Vicks Vapopads or whatever they`re called it does a great job and scenting the room with menthol; helps me breathe and relax!",5
1072649,2020 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Works good snug on the face,5
669122,2019 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Worked perfect for a week, then found floor to be soaking wet when I arrived home. Found that at any time it will seep water out the sides. Plastic around handle cracked, fan bearing grinding after 2 weeks.",2
1201356,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Only way to get any stream I had to add a dash of salt to the water but without it, no steam at all!",1

678179,2017 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,FANTASTIC! AND THE CHEAPER THAN IN ANY STORE!,5
930314,2020 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This product was damaged when I received it,a crack in the tank real small I kept because it was bad enough to be concerned, then as of March 3, I discovered a breakage along the carrying handle in the tank it just seem to be dry rotted I never have seem this happened to one ever before I cant even use it no more haven`t had it but 2 months, I`m very disappointed with it,",1
969060,2020 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Perfect size for my bedroom. Didnt want a giant one. Smaller size makes cleaning and refilling easier. My bedroom plants appreciate it! Not sure about my cactus haha,5
926198,2020 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,It seem to do exactly what it said it would do.. keep the room from getting overly dry. It does raise the temp of the room a few deg which is not a bad thing in my part of the US during the winter months. And the unit is very easy to store and clean up. But everytime it`s used there is a bit of black residue and that results in the electronic parts to wear out and I am sure it will eventually stop working.,4
672879,2018 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I`m a professional actor/singer base din NYC. This got me through a fully sung through show with haze. Terrific and relaxing.,5
924724,2020 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Dont purchase this item u can barley smell the vicks in any bedroom u put it in.,1
671879,2017 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,You may as well pull a $50 bill out of your wallet and light it on fire. This thing is garbage. Bought at Walmart in a pinch and couldnt be more unhappy.,1
1073001,2020 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This is a functional vaporizer that gets the job done. However, I`m not super satisfied for the following reasons:- This consumes lots of energy. Based on my back-of-envelope calculation, if I run this unit non-stop for a month, it would cost ~$40 in electricity bill.- The refill opening in the bottom is too small for me to put my hand inside to thoroughly clean the interior surface- If it runs out of water, the machine won`t restart automatically after the water is re-filled. I need to unplug and replug it to &quot;wake up&quot; the machine.",2
678209,2017 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I bought this little gadget to help with my sinus problems.It works wonders!,5
678607,2017 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This item was great, until the auto-shut off didn`t work & we have only had the unit for 8 days.We have radiator heat & I was having issues with severe dry throat, sinuses, etc.I had a larger Vicks Warm Mist humidifier previously that I loved so I purchased this item.It was the perfect size for a refill tank, wasn`t too loud & did what I needed to on the lowest setting - so I was excited.UNTIL my husband woke up to a burning smell & the tank was completely empty, but the heating unit did not shut off.So he immediately turned-off & unplugged it. Not plugging it back in to say the least.Our outlet or plug wasn`t hot, so this leads me to believe it is directly a unit issue, not a power outlet issue. Also we had been running for 8 days on that same outlet & only had a problem when the auto shut-off didn`t work.I hate that this has a questionable issue b/c I loved my previous Vicks Humidifier & this one was perfect, but I cannot repurchase this unit & sleep well knowing this happened previously.",1
1083613,2020 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This was a gift and for some reason AMAZON shipped 2 different ones like this in the box it came in.they did not even put it in a second box.Other then that I love the idem.thanks,5
676523,2017 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Always a great product for sick season. I`ve reordered it many times.,5
1034204,2020 / 08,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Horrible and cheap. Doesnt work at all. And was not able to return it.,1
926063,2020 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,It`s great fire sleeping,5
1180158,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,It works well in Dehumidifier,5

677434,2017 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Worked very well the first 3 times. The fourth time it simply would not emit steam.,2
676358,2017 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Very good vaporizer!It is quiet and emits just the right amount of vapor.Full tank is a bit heavy.,5
675049,2018 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,The girls loved it,5
672770,2018 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Not many warm mist humidifiers to choose from, so when I saw this, I bought it immediately. I`ve owned this unit now for a month, and so far so good. Filling up all the way makes the humidifier last way more than 8 hours, which is great for not having to worry about it running out halfway through the night.Added bonus is by the morning, this unit warms up my bedroom a bit. Two settings, low and high. I prefer the high setting so that it can act as white noise as well. Haven`t noticed any molding issues as other reviews mentioned, but will be sure to clean it since I am using tap water.I`ve forgotten to turn it off in the morning on a few occasions, and the unit doesn`t burn or hiss. I`m assuming that`s the auto shut-off function. There is a slot to pour inhalant into, which I haven`t used, but will try it out soon. A great humidifier for a great price.",5
1201724,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Toy big for bedroom,1
967798,2020 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Would buy again,5

1061735,2020 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This saves me at night with no humidity in NM!,5

1141411,2021 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I`ve purchased Vick`s humidifiers for a long time. Unfortunately, this is by far their worse one. It`s extremely noisy (sounds like it`s puffing the mist out the entire time), it stops expelling mist once it has reached about 50% of the water in the container (see picture -- you can see the water level at where it stops), the water has to be cleaned out daily because whatever water is left inside ends up with a bunch of lint-like residue in it (see picture -- that black stuff at the bottom). The salt in the water, it`s not a recommendation, it`s required! If you don`t drop salt in the water, mist will not come out. If you`re looking for something temp that you don`t care having to leave behind or throwing away after a couple months, go for it. But if you`re looking for something long-term, definitely go for the more expensive ones. I don`t write reviews on anything I buy, but this one was so bad, I felt like I needed to.",2
1244215,2022 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Just fine,5
664792,2020 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Good product for kids with colds or breathing issues.,5
673917,2018 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Even though I live at the beach, the air in my house in winter gets incredibly dry, which really caused me to get congested. This humidifier makes a big difference. I fill it before I go to sleep and it lasts the entire night on high. It`s easy to fill and quiet.",4
676518,2017 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Does what it is supposed to do.,5
671538,2018 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Love it,5
667562,2019 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"When I called Vicks to discuss it with them, they said that I needed to purchase a demineralization cartridge. In NYC we don`t have hard water and after 3 days, why would it stop? Why would I buy another part for (i.e. spend more money on) a product that already doesn`t work? Bad customer service. I called back hours later hoping I would get a different agent but as luck would have it, I got the same one. I asked for a supervisor and was told by him that I would be connected to his voice mail....7 minutes later, I was still on hold. Great unit when it works, Horrible customer service when it doesn`t.",1
665348,2019 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,works great,5
669362,2019 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Great product but gets expensive. Re oiling can get moldy. Only reoil one night.,5
1084556,2020 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Worked great in providing appropriate humidity in the air especially for sick children or adults alike. Use distilled water for less build up of minerals. Recommend frequent cleaning & a little time consuming but important. Its very easy to use.,5
1086240,2020 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Love this little machine. It clears my sinuses, helps ease head pain. I use it as a preventative also. I got mine at Wal-mart for $25. (2019) Since Covid, they jacked up the price to about $50. (online) Amazon seems to be the better price.",5
1253874,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Its very pretty and puts a lot of moisture in the air but they product completely stopped working in 5 weeks. Complete waste of money.,1
1213853,2022 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Stay far away from Vicks humidifiers, they may have a name but dont fall for it. Piece of trash made in china. The handle that you hold the filled jug cracked off while transporting and nearly flooded my apartment from the crash and fall. Absolute trash! Not to mention the amount of Humidity / mist it expels is a joke. Hardly anything. Literally you can hardly see the vapor unlike many other brands! Stay far far away from this trash humidifier. Take it from some who bought it and experienced it !",1
1255308,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Never detected the least bit of the vapor it was supposed to disburse. Will not order again.,2
1219878,2022 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,i love love LOVE this little thing it is tiny but mighty and i definitely recommend it if you have a cold,5
1020400,2020 / 07,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Great choice! Love it a lot. Been using for months.,5
666110,2019 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Love this humidifier since i been using it for 2 years every day from 7pm-8am. Only thing is it gets very difficult at the cleaning part. Trying to wash it with soap and sponge or even a bush doesnt work. I have to clean it every 2 weeks and getting those corners inside the tank is hard and my bone hurts. Over all love it after doing 30 min of cleaning.,3
924721,2020 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This came without being pa led in a box. I tho k it might have been used, but I needed it so I kept it.",1
928423,2020 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Worked well for about the first 20 nights it was used and then got progressively louder. Completely unusable after 30 nights of use as it now whirrs and groans loudly while barely producing any mist in high. I did clean the humidifier twice in it`s very short life.Look elsewhere.,1
675340,2017 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This is the best humidifier I`ve ever owned. This model is even better than past Vicks models. I now have 2 of them for different rooms in the house. The reservoir holds plenty of water that lasts a long time even though I use the middle to high vapor mist setting. I use the scented vapor pads and place them in the aromatherapy pocket on the side. I often refresh them with my own essential oils once they go dry. The first one I bought over 2 years ago and it still works great. So when I needed another for the living room, I got the same model. Most reliable, high output humidifier I`ve ever owned.",5
1147269,2021 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Great,5
967171,2020 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Works great,5
1165948,2021 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Used it only a few times a month and within the first year it just stopped producing any humid flow and started making a weird loud noise. Look for another brand,1

1242610,2022 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Found these when my twins had their first bad stuffy noses at just over a year old. I use one of these and one of the regular version in the two slots of their humidifier and they sleep great - one will even say I have boogers mommy, can we have a smelly pad? asking me to put them in. These are more gentle smelling than the regular which is nice so you have the option of which level of vicks you need",5
1178259,2021 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Container seems a little flimsy. But they worked,3
927589,2020 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Warm steam humidifiers are hard to find. This one is good! No white powder on your furniture like the ultrasonic ones and no filters to buy like the other cool steam ones. Easy to clean the heating element with a little vinegar at the end of the season.,5
1188739,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Great for kids room,4
1178862,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Advertisement is misleading. Photo indicated a traditional vaporizer; It is not. i will try it. Update later.,1

1148017,2021 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"The item did not have any fragrance. The vaporizer warmed up once it was plugged in, but either it didn`t get warm enough to release the fragrance or the fragrance pads were dry, but there was no fragrance at all. We tried it in 2 different rooms, small rooms, doors and windows were closed, and the vaporizer was plugged in for a long time.",1
664317,2019 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,My unit does not mist at all at any low or medium settings... and kicks in only at high setting.,1

1148126,2021 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I use this for my Vicks starry night humidifier. It is a little big so it fits very snug but it works just fine. I do wish they lasted a little longer.,5
1201782,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Is super quiet. On the low setting, the mist lasts most of the day. I can really tell a difference with my sinuses.",5

1047327,2020 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I love this humidifier its sits underneath my night stand and is very soothing throughout the night and it cuts off on its own !! Highly recommend this product especially if you feel stuffy while sleeping,5
1213247,2022 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,It atomizes very well. Very quite. Works well in a master bedroom. I place it on a portable dining tray next to the bed. I recommend two devices. A cool mist and a warm mist.,5

1181223,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Unrefundable even when defective, quits at half full tank. Heavy then to lift &amp; lug to the sink! Very comforting SOUND. humidity can reach peak in 2hrs..causes a replug in issue every few hrs..so it`s a bother. Very hard to wrangle top off to refill..makes it difficult for little kids, which is great.",4

1206980,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This is a nicely sized unit. It runs very quiet during the overnight, unfortunately, the condensation in the unit makes a constant dripping sound (think faucet dripping all night), which makes sleeping impossible. Returned it.",2
673811,2018 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Works great in my grow tents. Have it on a timer to control the amount of misting.,5
677063,2017 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"It generates good steam and lots of it. BUT when tank is empty unit does not automatically shut off, even tho it`s advertised that way. I have had two of these and both burned out, because heater kept working even tho no water remaining in the tank. I give it 2 stars because it makes great steam, is easy to use and will significantly increase humidity in short while. I have purchased it again because it`s easy to use and increases humidity fairly quickly. I have purchased 2 cool mist humidifiers but have returned them since they don`t generate enough mist.I have given it 2 stars because the auto-shut off does not work. I would give it 5 stars if the auto-shut off worked. I will just keep my eye on it when water level is down. Another good feature is low purchase price. I am going to write to Vicks about the auto-shut off not working, and post here later what I hear from them, if they answer!",2
669639,2019 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Works as advertised,5
1112838,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Clearly a broken unit. Bought this to replace the same one thats leaking everywhere. Heating element doesnt even heat. Does not work whatsoever.,1
1202659,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"We have 4 of these. About 6 months in we usually notice an increase in sounds. The plastic ring on the cap that keeps the water scaled tight gets rough and a bit difficult to open as opposed to the smooth opening in the beginning when first purchased. After a year, 1 of them fully stopped working. After about 5 months 1 was very loud and Anson replaced it promptly.",5

1046713,2020 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Use an ice cream pail lid underneath if you don`t want your furniture to warp by this. I`ve got a nice big ring on my new dresser now.,3
669243,2019 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This product was great for like 3 nights after that, it stopped bubbling even after we put the salt in and we cant even smell the vapor liquid. Also every morning, when we clean it there seems to be some black residue in the water and I`m sure if that`s good for my child. WOULD NOT PURCHASE AGAIN!",1
678062,2017 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,i was about 4 months pregnant when I got really sick from my son. It was the middle of summer and at night I was having trouble sleeping. This ting is so amazing. I have one similar for my son`s room but it was somewhere in storage so I ordered another one. Very good quality and it doesn`t leak.,5
667819,2018 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Its works great. Love the little cleaning fish in the tank!! An I use distilled water in it an the little pads with lavender are great that goes in the side.,5
663817,2019 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,excelente,5
664490,2019 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,We sleep in our basement and with the furnace running it is so dry that we wake up and our sinuses were burning. When we received this machine we were both happy about it. Due to the mini size it helps the person who is closest to the machine rather than the person on the other side of the bed however it still makes it much easier to wake up and not feel like garbage!,4
1072384,2020 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Works great for my kids,5

668644,2019 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"We bought to replace a Vicks older version. Thought the nightlight might be fun. NOPEIts way too bright in a darkened room and not near bright enough in a brighter room.The mist is not visible at all. The whole filter thing mystifies me (no pun intended) In fact, it didn`t use any perceptible amount of water overnight. We wanted to return it but IT`S NOT ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN>",1
1153453,2021 / 07,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I love the way it puts moisture in the air. It`s easy to fill and clean. I highly recommend this product to increase the humidity in your room.,5
675037,2018 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Real quiet, works great in Colorado.",5
673478,2018 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Weve had two of these in the last year and the knobs have broken off of both of them.,1
1251543,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I`ve had mine 4 years now. Keep in my bedroom for when winter gets here. I cant believe it`s still working as good as day I bought it! Especially when I only use it during winter & rest of time it sets. It still very quiet. I clean it with vinegar/water. I now need one for my living room.,5
674205,2018 / 08,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This is the second one I bought, and after 2 months, it`s broken again! Save your money, but a better one!",1
1181233,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Bought this for my mom. Her other on quit working. This is smaller than her old one. The smaller size works well for her to handle. She is very pleased.,5
671490,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Amazing vaborizer! For as small as it is, when in use, its power allows the smell to take up the entire large living room.",5
664983,2019 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Nice product,4
670574,2019 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,It`s hard to empty all the water out. It does not last 18-24 it says plus there is black metal stuff in the bottom. I empty it every day and put clean water.,1

1213130,2022 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Stopped working after a couple of weeks. We started using it few weeks after our purchase. It worked for a couple of weeks then, no steam after that. Emptied and Cleaned everyday per instructions.To our disappointment, the return window expired 3 days after it broke down. I wish it came with a warranty. But not sure if it would have helped.",1
1238435,2022 / 08,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Throught out time I feel like the bucks solution has gotten a little thiner but other than that it works great,3
1250366,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Bought it 2 weeks ago. It works like a charm. Keeps the air moist so ot helps my cough and my skin is moist in the morning. Provides hours of relief. It`s a great 2 in one deal ... 2 thumbs up!!,5
674112,2018 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Wish the scent lasted longer..,3
723967,2018 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Very easy to put together. So far I like it.,5
1250402,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Although it did work well, I`m not willing to spend an hour cleaning it every week. I`ll just wait for it to die and get a better one.",3
1035312,2020 / 08,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Not as much lavender aroma as anticipated,3
1061133,2020 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This is by far the worst humidifier that i have ever bought, it barely works even after adding salt to the water! This was a waste of money, i will be buying a different design of Vicks humidifiers.",1
1102170,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Easy to use and very helpful for little ones trying to sleep!,5
924910,2020 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Rating it only a single star because the feature we bought this for doesn`t work. We could`ve gotten a bigger or even same size humidifier for the same price without the projector for what this one does.Due to only one bulb in this one working you can`t make out any of the pictures except for faint outlines.Tried talking to the folks at 1-800-827-6712 and was told that not only would I have to pay for return shipping but also that they wouldn`t send one out while I sent this one back. If that isn`t the case then you need to get the customer service reps retraining.TLDR : Don`t buy this to have a humidifier with a neat feature as it doesn`t work.,1
1140074,2021 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This works awesome along with the inhaler. The lavender smells so good and lasts beyond the time frame on the box.,5
670168,2019 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I need to have some control of the humidity in my bedroom. A good check on the humidifier I use.,5
1062487,2020 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,The product at first worked fine and later stopped working and hums without the cool steam. Also the tank got clouded up and uneasy to clean. I would need to return it for a refund. Thanks,2
1126259,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Not as good as they use to be. The little pads that you put in them were dried out so had to buy new ones and it still didn`t put out much scent.,2
678391,2017 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"During my first four overnight uses of this humidifier it leaked overnight on three of those nights. Fortunately, I placed it in a pan. It seems to leak as the water level gets low overnight as it did not leak when water level was higher as the unit sat still in the off state during the day. Amazon was kind enough to send a replacement at no cost. Unfortunately, the replacement functioned the same way and leaked. I am returning the replacement unit as well for a refund. The large reservoir in the base which is normally dry when the unit is initially filled becomes filled with water after use and it is from this area that it appears to spill over the edge later in the evening.",1
674484,2018 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Worked great at first, after a couple of weeks it started leaking. very unhappy !",1
665401,2020 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Very good for my baby,5
1206833,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Produces very little steam, not worth buying",2
1060306,2020 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Love this product. It helps my kids breathe easier when they have colds.,5
677780,2017 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Not worth buying. Cool steam one is way better. This was not a good but for me.,1
678265,2017 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"It works well for my five year old and myself. We swim a lot year round and it helps to keep nasal congestion away caused by chlorine water, winter elements, and allergens. Makes life a lot easier. No more post nasal drip or runny noses after swimming. the steam does get very hot so be careful putting you face to close. Otherwise no complaints it does the job and its a great product.",5
1213934,2022 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"It shipped from Mexico and I was hesitant, but also desperate. One never worked, the other was fine.",1
672809,2017 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,i like the fact that now u dont need a spungie filter along with the humidifier. and it is much eseyer to use then the old kinds.,5
1034861,2020 / 08,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I was very disappointed by this humidifier - it only produced steam 1 time. I do not recommend it.,1
670899,2019 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This is a 4 month review of the vaporizer.Overall :This has a gallon capacity with a night light at the top in the shape of vicks. It has low water cutoff feature and it cuts off the heater element as soon as it runs out of water or the water level falls down.General capacity:The water in my area has very low mineral capacity. I add a spoon of general salt every 15 days and refill water every day. Every 15 days, I clean the whole machine and refill the water completely.It generally comes for the whole night and it fills a room of around 70 sq. ft well.I also use it with the vicks liquid and add a few drops of eucalyptus oil at the top cup provided. The whole room gets filled pretty quickly and it says that way.Care should be taken to provide some height to the machine so that every one in the room can get the vapors.Do not place ay electronic items like cell phones near the machine since they will tend to get wet pretty soon. Keep them in a good distance.Final conclusion:Works well, needs some salt based on the water souce, clean every 15 days if you add salt since salt will leave some black sediments, good amount of vapor for a small room.Ability to cut off , night light, decent vapor throw, cup for adding oils or medicines, vicks medication for adding in water - were the major factors that made me add 5 stars.Cons:- The size could have been a little bigger. One gallon seems too small- The vapor mouth is not exactly all great- The shape is awkward, it is not easy to lift it after filling it with waterOverall the pros trump the cons for me and hence i stay with it. For 15 bucks this was a great deal for me in winter and helped keep the skin hydrated.",5
678309,2017 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"If you have hard water you will need to add salt,and that`s ok. The steam (or water) does not last as long as they say. If had to do over again I would spend more money for a better long lasting steamer. Good for small room for several hours. We needed a vaporizer fast to help with sick grandson,so bought one that day.",3
1161355,2021 / 08,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Does not work. There is no change in moisture in the air for us with two units on high in one medium sized room. Hoping to return them tomorrow.,1

670818,2019 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,We bought 2 to be fair and verify the review in a controlled environment and based it off of our experience. There was immediate issues with one unit. The other units seem to be working good for a maximum of two weeks. Currently both units run for a maximum of 30 minutes and then completely shut off. They need to be shut off and unplugged for a period of time for them to reset and even turn on. This purchase was made due to the fact that Vicks is a big name and we have had their products in the past. Huge mistake that I will not Make again!!,1

677860,2017 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I personally didn`t like the smell of these at all. I didn`t read the bad reviews. I agree with everyone who said that it smells like really stinky awful cleaning products. It does not smell like Lavendar to me at all. The combination of the rosemary, eucalyptus and lavendar make up something completely different that smellsLike a bad cheap cleaning product. Awful. And I felt that I became worse after using this. The regular menthol was much better. It was far from a relaxing smell.",1

Soothing relief from coughing and congestion from the flu. In reading up on steam inhalers it`s nice to know they help with opening pores on your face, too. It`s doing double duty.

1201661,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Yes it takes a few minutes for the machine to warm to make steam, no it`s not like you`re standing in the middle of a very hot shower, but is it enough steam and Vapor to inhale to give you relief and breathe?? ABSOLUTELY! we don`t need a &amp;quot;hot shower performance&amp;quot; of steam to open our sinuses. If that`s what you expect then take a hot shower. Would I recommend this? Yes. Is this little thing worth it, yes. Did it help me fight Covid, yes again!! worked great in my opinion ;-)",4
671800,2018 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Fan is noisy and often whirls and makes an awful sound when starting or refilling. Not a quiet and peaceful unit to have in a bedroom. Requires noise machine to drown out motor sound. Should have returned shortly after receiving it.,1

670884,2019 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This has been running fine for about a year, I`m finally fed up with the garbage design though. Extreme corners in the basin prevent you from easily cleaning this. The tank is awful. Sure the pictures show you cleaning inside except it neglects to show how awful it is the clean around the opening and it`s also stair stepped from the opening That`s right, all those delicious 90 angles for black mold to latch onto. The tube that the mist emits from is fine to clean, except for this weird inset rectangular recess that`s too deep to effectively reach in and just too narrow for standard bottle brushes to clean in. On top of that most bottle brushes don`t efficiently clean those 90 corners where three sides meet each other. If easy to clean, so you don`t expose yourself and family to aeresol mold because you somehow didn`t notice that one spot inside the tank between the tube and the opening that only 2-3cm wide, is your main goal here then pass on this product. It`s way overpriced for the headache and frustration that is causes. For that 2cm gap inside the tank, try a toothbrush snapped in half.",2

674921,2018 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Love this humidifier!! I had started getting very dry, scabby, painful sores in my nostrils, and couldn`t figure out what was up. Finally a week or so of pondering on it, I realized it probably was coming from our bedroom, which is the coolest part of the house, and driest. It also has lots of air flowing (ceiling fan on high, close above high bed, 3 small box fans for the 3 dog`s crated in our room). I have no allergies and am very healthy so I knew sinuses were not the problem. We both love the coolness and peace our bedroom brings after a long day in the draining humid heat. Our bedroom is in the back of our rather long house, and our big air/heat unit is outside our window, so it really is a cool, and dry space, which I love. My husband sleeps with a CPAP machine and swears the reason he never gets sick is that it constantly delivers clean moist air all night long...think he is onto something! I have in the past used a cool mist humidifier in the winter, but honestly I`m so healthy, I haven`t thought about one in years until now. I of course came to Amazon to start my search and spent 3hrs reading reviews, and got very frustrated and completely OCD about one!!! All seem to have great features and terrible ones. Feeling like I was wasting time and fretting over something actually trivial in the scheme of life, I shut down the computer, drove to Walmart and purchased this one in 5 minutes of looking at their selection. I didn`t want a filter. We are on a well, and I use our water in it, but will probably switch to distilled. We keep it on hand for the CPAP, and it`s cheap. I`ve only had this for about a week, but the very 1st morning after using it, nose was moist and clear!! That was worth the $40 I paid for it, and no problems since!! Was using coconut oil in my nostrils and as much as I love it for my body and cooking, coating the inside of my nostrils with it was gross, but did soften the scabby sores. A humidifier is a much better answer getting to the root of the problem. People complain about noise...we Love noise, and besides all the fans going, sleep with a white noise machine. I will say that this machine is very quiet to me, and is easy, easy to fill and maintain. I have cleaned it with white vinegar and water, and didn`t read the tedious instructions through. Seems like common sense. I placed it on a bureau and turned the mist nozzle my direction, about 10 ft from my side of the bed. I sleep with an essential oil diffuser by my bed so I don`t care if it has that option or even have to worry whether it actually works in that way. I just wanted and needed some moisture in the air, and not pay an arm and a leg for it if it breaks. I`m very satisfied, highly recommend this simple humidifier to anyone needing one and not wanting to spend hrs and hrs freaking out finding the very right one, for just a bedroom. If I needed one for my whole house, of course I would research more, and spend more. But this size, that holds a gallon and half approximately, is perfect to run all day and night. I fill it when I think it needs it, and don`t let it run out until I want to clean it. Which knowing me, I will do at least once a week, just like I do my Britta pitcher. If you need a cool mist, filter free, humidifier, then try this one. I do set it in a small pan, just to protect the wood on dresser. Don`t notice any dust or excess moisture and leave it on high all day and night, with door open. Like my EO diffuser, I love seeing the visible mist letting me know that moisture really is coming in the room :)",5

664740,2019 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Fighting colds in dry winter air is no fun; we needed something to add humidity. I did not want ultrasonic because of the cold mist and the mineral dust. This looks a lot like the ultrasonic models, but there is actually a tiny boiler in the unit. It works great! $33 in the store is just twice the cost of a cheap `vaporizer` that will not last very long. On high setting the unit went through almost a full tank over night, just as advertised. And it was very quiet, with just a slight sound from the bubbles in the boiler, much like a cooking pot on simmer. Mine is brand new so I have not had to clean it, though that look easy enough. We will see about reliability; I`m sure it will get used a lot.",5

1031356,2020 / 08,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I have used an older version of this personal steam inhaler for over 10 years every time my sinuses started acting up. I am very please with the updated version. The quality is good and It produces a tremendous amount of steam. The steam is adjustable and because I like to put my face completely in the mask I need to turn it way down otherwise its way too hot. This is meant to be used on a stable surface so the boiling water does spill on you. I tried to use a neti pot but I worry about the distilled water and cleanliness. I use tap water with the steamer and do not have to worry about that. I highly recommend this steamer.,5

929340,2020 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"It is impossible to find a humidifier that has all of the features I want, easy to clean, easy to fill, no white dust everywhere and not making my bedroom cold from blowing cold air over a filter.This one comes close, as close as I think I will ever get. It is super easy to fill; however, even though I only run it at night while I`m sleeping, it will run out of water if set on high. In other words, the tank isn`t as big as many others.The mist is very hot, I don`t have any small children around and the dog appears smart enough not to put his nose near the opening where the mist comes out, but it does seem hot enough to possibly burn small fingers or hands.The instructions for cleaning are very clear, unlike the last one I had. And the heating element is extremely easy to reach once the unit is taken apart. I began using a brita pitcher this year for filling the unit and cleaning has been way easier, though it would still be better than the last one which made it so difficult to reach the heating element that I threw it out after one frustrating winter.I would give it another star if it had a slightly larger tank so I could run it on high all night, it doesn`t raise the humidity as far as I would like on low, but it keeps it from dropping to un-breathable levels. Also, the light is ridiculously bright. It shines through the switch, which I covered with a piece of electrical tape, it shines through the water tank, which I covered with an opaque cloth, thinking the first night that this would eliminate lighting up my very dark room. NOT! The light literally shines through the white plastic covering the heating element area, a white plastic you cannot see thru and I can`t cover! But it glows a bright green.The light part is not cool, way too bright. The rest I can work with, so for now it`s a keeper.",4
1128239,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I was disappointed with this item. The built in vapor slot, did nothing for me. No smell and you pay for expensive Patches to put in it. Hard to tell how much to fill with water. Sloppy when you need to add more water.",2

I like the night light on top its not too bright yet bright enough. I am pleased with this product, the price was good.

The level and sound of the white noise from the mister is perfect. I have used various white noise sources and this mister is nirvana.

I should have stopped right there. I unboxed only to find the tabs that hold the actual pump had been broken. Took back issued refund receipt only to receive a debit to my account.

678342,2017 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Must be cleaned frequently to prevent the growth of mold.,4
669619,2019 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I must start by saying this is my first warm mist unit and maybe my gripes are an artifact of that. First the pros, It does a decent job of creating a nice mist and humidifying my bedroom. Filter free is kinda nice too, but......... The cons. Water everywhere. The instructions recommend to put on a water tight surface, yea, I would say so! There is a vent at the bottom and condensate collects all over and underneath the removable water pan, tray, whatever you want to call it. As such, water will come out of the bottom. The feel also have holes in them and this is another avenue of water coming out of the bottom. Not torrents mind you, but a disturbing amount that will ruin furniture and should be checked daily. I have min sitting in a cookie sheet pan to keep this from happening. Why design like that? Not only that, I agree with other reviews I have read that cleaning is a rather absurd experience. Water vapor gets all over the bottom of the heating tower and will invariably dribble down into the unit - so far has not hit the electronics - yet. LOTS of people say the old design the element was removable and while I did not have an old unit the design flaw is intuitively poor. Also, water gets all over the bottom of the reservoir. So when you lift it out to refill, its not just a slight dribble as the base of the water tank was in the pan, but All Of The Condensate that collects on the bottom of the reservoir - that is not directly in contact with water, dribbles everywhere as soon as the tank is lifted out and tipped even just barely. Now that is a good amount of water. I bring a towel with me do I dont drench the carpet when removing for refill. I have had other units with the same design of screw base with spring loaded plunger and never had any of them collect, retain and dribble so much! Finally your water quality is definitely of a concern. I used regular tap water and in One Day! I had a significant amount of scale and slime in the part of the pan into which the heating element resides. I have started using water from my Zero Water pitcher and this has helped dramatically. My water reads about 250ppm with the mater from the water filter and with the Zero Water it is OK when below 10ppm. If you do not have access to a good water filter, you will certainly need to buy DI water. If not, dont even bother with this unit. Again, this is my first warm mist and might happen to all of this type. All in all, while not worthy of an effort to return, I could not recommend to someone else. Gets a few stars as it works and is filter free.",3
1072425,2020 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Not many options to buy in bulk. Since its that season. You can go through them quickly. So this worked out best.,4
673148,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This unit helped me to recover from a severe cough, perhaps bronchitis. I slept with it each night and also used it for several hours during each day. I could not figure out how to clean it as mentioned in the instructions, though, because I could not put my finger over the steam hole without removing the screws and taking off the blue part. And I didn`t have a screwdriver that would remove those strange looking screws. Also I thought from the instructions for cleaning that I was supposed to immerse the whole black unit in vinegar water to clean it. However, I then read a review written by redwagon, and that review told me I could remove the probes and that then the unit would fit into a Pyrex 2-cup measuring cup. That is correct. It won`t take so much vinegar that way. I finally found a very thin L-shaped tool (may be called an Allen wrench) that enabled me to remove those two screws. I would suggest that a tool to remove those screws should come with the vaporizer.",5

The amount of bleach they recommend doesn`t cut it and it likely needs to be done every single time (stain is still there after several bleachings). I`m currently shopping for another one. Shame, this was worked amazing. Just really hard to open and close the tank plug when refilling, and impossible to clean the hard to reach areas. I tried q-tip, toothbrush, toothpick -- nothing can reach/bend/fit into the one area to clean it. Sadly will be throwing it out. /",3

676367,2017 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Growing up, Vicks vapor rub was a staple item in the medicine cabinet; it was used for just about everything. Got a cough? Vicks to the rescue. Got a scrape? Vicks would probably work. Bug bite? Vicks. Sniffles, headache, ear ache, stomach ache...Vicks. Naturally this seemed like a good idea since it combined steam with good old Vicks. Except it doesn`t. If you expect a steam version of the old fashioned vapor rub then keep looking because this isn`t really up to the job. It packs a very weak punch, cannot be used in a cold diffuser (only heat) and frankly, I found it inferior to using a basic essential oil. Would not buy again in the future.",3

I had her door closed but not pulled shut, I went upstairs to check on her because she started crying and the Vic`s smelled filled the entire upstairs hallway after just 20 mins which explains the reason she was caughing at first. the humidifier was on the low setting. I had to open the door to air out her room. It definitely will clear you up but I wouldn`t recommend the regular Vicks inserts for babies. I`m going to try and get the ones that pediatricians recommend for babies and see if it`s less powerful.",4

I guess it`s OK because I doubt anyone would want to steal a humidifier but it was just weird compared to how most other things ship from Amazon. Otherwise, this works great. I haven`t had a chance to use the inhalant yet but I`d imagine that would be very nice if you had a head cold of sorts and used this in a smaller room. I typically run it on low while my husband and I sleep and there is typically enough in the tank to run it all night over 2 nights on low, 1 night on high.",4

673281,2018 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Its super annoying to fill. You have to flip the tank over and fill then flip back over and sometimes water somehow splashed out all over.

My bedroom is fairly large and it covers a wide area. The night light isn`t too bright but enough so you know where it is. No switches, just plug it up and leave it.

1103005,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"It`s overall nice, looks nice, does it`s job, but mine arrived with a leak from the top seam of the tank (not where you fill it). It`s annoying but also not worth the hassle of returning it.",3
677044,2017 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"We bought this for our 3 month old daughter who got sick. We loved how quiet it was and worked well. Only thing we didn`t like is the water compartment part doesn`t ever get secured into the base. It just sits on top. So if you move it and don`t reposition the water container part just right, it won`t work. We love it though!",5
670861,2019 / 08,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"After a lot of research and inquiry on which humidifier to purchase, I decided to buy this one (I didn`t purchase from Amazon because I didn`t know if I`d like it and there are no free returns with this item). I have used an expensive Boneco one and recently bought another one that was very high tech on Amazon that did not work. This Vick`s mini humidifier is small yet very powerful! The vapor stream is stronger than my Boneco one, and the best part is that even after running it on high all day or night, there is NO MOISTURE on anything around it. It is simple to use and clean. Originally, I wanted a larger top-fill reservoir, but this one is so easy to fill compared to my former Boneco tank, that I am happy it is smaller now! I have really good hearing and I find it is super quiet. I use it to keep my sinuses clear and my face hydrated. It is right next to my bed.",5

I didnt realize this meant it couldnt be returned!",2
668260,2019 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,works awesome. have the vicks lavender pads that I use in it. love the scent. helps me sleep better. chest feels so much better. I also use the vicks lavender vaporub. the combination works awesome. highly recommend these products,5

It works as a standard humidifier, but it also has a warming tray that you can place essential oils or Vicks oils in. This unit came with a sample scented pad. I love that it can be used with a wide variety of products, not just Vicks brand ones. The humidifier itself has an adjustable dial and a relatively large tank. I was able to set the direction of the mist as well as the intensity. I didnt even fill it up all the way and it lasted the entire night. It helped alleviate congestion that I was experiencing.

1201892,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I purchased a warm steam vaporizer from Vicks. It`s fantastic. The Vapo pads are menthol and last up to 8hours of relief. I prefer to use this instead of medication. We were all very congested from Covid and we used the vaporizer for a few nights and it was a big relief.,5
1191141,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Couldn`t use these - cleared the room they smelled so strong. If they were maybe half strength, then possibly but they are just too strong smelling.",3

1071887,2020 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I love this Vicks Humidifier. It is very easy to fill which you can see is because it has a large fill hole. You can use it with or without the Vicks VapoPads. I use it every night . You just adjust the steam to your preference. The picture shows the highest output which since you can see it in the pic is a lot of steam. It is a cool Humidifier so you don`t have to worry about burning yourself. It`s also good to use in kids rooms because it isn`t hot. This replaced my old bulky Vicks unit which was a pain to carry once it was filled up and it look alot of space. This one is easy to carry since the tank detaches and it has a conveniant handle. The color is beautiful and is a must for hot pink lovers, lol. I hope this helps with your decision. Also remember that Vick`s is a trusted brand that has been around for years.",5

I see that people on here complain about the steam control and how it gets really hot. What I do is cover myself with a small blanket or towel under with the steamer and I don`t really put my face in it unless I don`t want to. But it works perfectly fine. It`s like I`m sauning just my face lol and I do use the vicks pad. So for those who has trouble breathing it because its too hot. I recommend trying it under a blanket. It might be better.

676165,2017 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"it works very well. I have it operate in my bedroom at night. The vapo and menthol pads work nicely, as well. Very soothing. One downside, though, it is more difficult to refill than expected. For people with R/A in their hands it may be too difficult. The water reservoir when almost full is very heavy and can be slippery when taken from bathroom faucet to bedroom. Refilling on site is an option but the danger if spillage onto the furniture and carpet is not a comfortable thought.Would I buy it again, yes.",4

Then I got this STEAM Humidifier - LAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! Wowser this works GREAT!!!! it boils the water so you don`t have to worry about germs and bacteria. The steam is MUCH more effective that the cool mist - no white dust - much more moisturizing. the water tank has handles on both ends - makes SO much easier to carry full of water. MUST clean the steamer part white vinegar ever couple of days if you have hard water - no matter to me since i buy it by the galleon anyway.",5

I turn it on with a full reservoir of water,and within 15 minutes the reset button comes on, turning the unit off. I have to wait for 30 minutes or more, then try to turn the unit on again, with the same results. I used it for the winter months, then repacked it in the same box and put it away inside the house, in a closet, for the warmer more humid months. I brought this unit out of storage recently, and this problem started right away. I recently bought a different make and model of humidifier, wish me luck that it will last longer than this one did.",1

1128861,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I use the eucalyptus/menthol vapor pads with the cool mist vaporizer. The result is a fine mist with a soothing scent that is not overpowering. It is a little difficult to put two pads in the compartment and close it so each time I change the pads, I have to fiddle with closing the compartment. Perhaps the vaporizer unit design could be updated to address this issue. We live in an apartment. Our furnace has a humidifier but the air is still very dry. I don`t know how to adjust the furnace. Therefore, the vaporizer is necessary and the essential oil pads make the vapor mist smell nice and seems to be better than using just the water without the vapor pads.",5

It is hard to get the deposit off the heating element, needs white vinegar and you cannot use an abrasive cleaner on it so we are trying to get it off with a hard toothbrush. Still soaking hours later. The smell when it started to make a noise was awful, a burning smell, it scared us that it was burning the unit up.

And this thing molds ridiculously fast (it had to completely take mine apart and clean it every 3 days because it would start getting nasty and smell of mildew) and has tiny areas or hard to reach places (even when taken apart) that you just cant get to to clean, which releases mold into the air for your littles to breathe in.

677074,2017 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"The best feature of this humidifier is that you can pour water right in the top without having to remove the tank - although you can remove the tank to refill it if you want to.There`s a demineralization cartridge included if you want to use tap water and live in a hard water area. My town has extremely hard water so I don`t even try using it in my humidifiers because I know it will clog them up eventually, plus the mist will leave a white dust on nearby surfaces. I only use distilled water - I figure it`s worth the cost of buying distilled if it extends the life of my humidifiers and produces a cleaner mist. So, I can`t speak to the effectiveness of the Vicks demineralization cartridges but it`s a nice optional feature if you need it. If you`re into scents, there`s a sample menthol pad that you can stick in a special compartment, but I haven`t yet tried this.I have a PureGuardian humidifier that I prefer simply because it`s quieter. This Vicks humidifer is just way too noisy for a bedroom. There`s a small motor hum that I could live with, but there`s a constant trickling/gurgling sound that my PureGuardian humidifier doesn`t have. If you`re planning on using this in a bedroom, I can`t recommend it, but if noise is not an issue then this is a very good humidifier. I`d say it`s similar to a fish tank in noise level. It works great at humidifying a room, but it seems like the designers could have focused more on making it quieter, especially as I know there are quiet humidifiers on the market.Another thing I don`t like about this humidifier is that the spout can only be rotated 180 degrees, so if you want the mist to point backward towards the humidifer, you can`t do that unless you remove the spout and put it in backwards, which it isn`t designed to do because it doesn`t fit properly. My PureGuardian humidifer spout swivels 360 degrees so I can point the mist in any direction.",3
1202102,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I purchased the humidifier less than a month ago online &amp; have been using it almost every night. When I first started using it I was very impressed, but soon to be very disappointed. It is simple to set up, easy to clean, gave off a huge amount of &amp;quot;mist&amp;quot; but now gives off nothing. I have cleaned it, I have used distilled water to see if that makes a difference, I have tried everything and it no longer pushes out any &amp;quot;mist&amp;quot;. Don`t waste your money on this humidifier, stick with the ugly ones that some how last for forever. Very disappointed.",1

671981,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I was skeptical about buying this due to some of the reviews. I wish now i would have not bought it. I had in my bedroom for 2 nights and 1 day constantly running with door closed. It only went up 2% in humidity. And, like other reviewers mentioned, it left white dust all over the furniture, which means it everywhere else I cant see ( bedding, carpet, etc). I used soft water...I suppose distilled water would solve that, but now you are just adding to the cost and hassle. Will be returning it to the store...In my opinion whole house humidifiers installed on the furnace ductwork are the only way to change humidity correctly, had 2 in my previous home and worked great. Was going for the cheaper alternative in my smaller house with this product( bought 2 for 2 bedrooms), but they dont work well....",1

The past two humidifiers I`ve bought have either not worked or not worked consistently. One never worked from the start, so I returned it, figuring it was just that one. The one I have now worked for about a month, but started to work inconsistently, making unusual noises, and now doesn`t work at all. I`ve tried everything I can think of to get it to work, but nothing has worked. I won`t be buying this humidifier again- it`s no longer worth anywhere close to the price. The only reason I gave it a 2/5 stars and not 1/5 was because my purchases of this product were good for awhile.",2

1220060,2022 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Best one so far ! I had at least 8 different ones before I found this humidifier. You cannot go wrong with it. I bought a second one for another room. I would give more stars if I could.,5
668602,2019 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Living in the Southwest is a challenge with the winter harsh dryness and static when touching things.

I clean it completely (wipe out both parts with a towel) out about twice a week so no bacteria or lime/calcium builds up. There is a quiet hum but unless you like it dead quiet to fall asleep it isn`t bothersome. It works great!,4

1114157,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This unit put out a LOT of moisture which settled on all our furniture and clothes in our bedroom but did not raise the humidity in the room.

Just had to do it again and hand force wasn`t enough, it took a soft hammer and screwdriver to open it.Have been trying to barely close the cap to avoid this but it does not help. Perhaps the vibrations of the unit are what makes it tighter.That said, it works very well. I see other reviewers complain about pink stain and mold but that is just a fact of life with stagnant water and time. It isn`t an easy clean but also not terribly difficult as well. Our prior Vicks humiifier products had that filter which would mold and rot very quickly. This is not a problem with this filterless model.",4

After than, it stopped blowing steady steam and the motor was struggling, i could hear it turning off (not working.. stopping) unless i tapped on it continuously. I had to buy another unit to replace it so maybe i got a lemon but it`s too late to return/exchange. Also i found some small dirt or unidentifiable debris of some kind inside the tank each time i refilled it. Added salt once but it made no difference. You may have a better experience.",3

678746,2017 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I bought 2 of these units from another retailer. At first use they were great. They helped greatly with breathing since they have the small well that holds the menthol liquids. After 1 week of use they both started to leak. As long as they were running they didn`t leak at all but as soon as they were turned off, all the water lest in the bottom of the humidifier would leak out the bottom of both units. I found it quite odd that they both developed the same problem. I returned them both but I liked them when they worked. They should have lasted longer than a week.",2

1124428,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] We`re a forever Vicks household and this vaporizer proves why. It`s SO easy to set up and the steam is immediate. It produces a great cloud for a substantial amount of time so I know we`re not going g to wake up with try throats and noses.,5
983822,2020 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Great smells great,5
1219512,2022 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I bought this because it was cheap and what I was looking for. I have a small balcony in my kitchen and my cats love watching the birds....so I make cat `television ` by putting some bird seed out. I don`t use a railing feeder for fear it will fall and hurt someone or break something. This is just what I needed. The birds eat all the food in a day but it`s never been tipped over or blown away by weather. Highly recommend!,5
1072376,2020 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Love these for stuffy nose nights. They definitely help. My only drawback is they are a bit expensive.,5
678553,2017 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Works great,5
677751,2017 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Use this in my son`s bedroom when he has a cold. Helps him breathe at night. Love the auto shut-off function. I have been known to forget about it when getting him up in the morning and it will run dry. So far no harm has been done and I used it off an on during the winter. I do put this up on a small bedside table and put a towel underneath it to help catch the condensation. Otherwise a puddle can occur on our hardwood floors. This also happens with the other types of humidifiers we have in the house.,5
1133246,2021 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This is the best humidifier I`ve ever had! It wasn`t super expensive, but it`s very effective, and it very easily comes all the way apart for cleaning. No more sinus infections from using a moldy humidifier! The only thing that keeps us from being absolutely perfect, is that you can`t reliably get every last drop out of the tank. This must just be how humidifiers are designed, because I`ve never seen one where you can actually just dump out the water and not have a little left stuck in the corners. BUT this one comes really close!!",5

I suffer from this and the vaporizer has helped to control and keep it to a minimum. Highly recommend it. My only negative is that it sometimes needs salt due to quality of the water in your area which is a small hassle.,5

Don`t be afraid of the reviews and pictures where they say it cracked... Just be smart and don`t refill it with cold water when it`s already heated up. Also be careful if you move it while it`s steaming, as the hot water could spill out of the edges and burn you-- again, just be smart and careful.It does take a bit of time to heat up, but not extraordinarily long-- it is what it is- the water has to heat up enough to boil and steam off.This is so helpful when the weather outside is cold and dry and not conducive to coughs. It`s portable and handy. I have both hand washed and dishwashed (on the gentle cycle) the pieces that don`t have electrical components and it`s always come out really well, hence perhaps why it`s lasted me so many years in perfect condition.",5

However what kills it for me is that I am a VERY light sleeper and every hour or so it will make this god awful gurgling noise that makes me think my wife or dogs are dying. It wakes me up every time.. So we`re going to get rid of it for that reason. But if that won`t bother you, it`s a good humidifier.",2
672895,2018 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Its working good! Season is super dry in California..,4
928935,2020 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Great thank you ,5
674115,2018 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This is a pretty good alternative the significantly pricier My PurMist steam inhaler which stopped working abruptly for me last week.This inhaler can use tap water. It takes some time to heat up but the steam is strong. It recommends tabletop use but I have not had any problems holding it to use. The mask part is enormous and loose but with some careful positioning it can be placed closer to the face if you need that.,4
676117,2017 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Simple and cheap, like the ones I grew up with.",4
668045,2018 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This humidifier works well, and I love that it doesn`t need a filter. It also isn`t nearly as large as our older humidifier, so it takes up much less space. I`m definitely considering buying a 2nd for another part of the house.",5
674042,2018 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Honestly trash. does not work unless you put salt, and it tells you not to use salt too much. This is trash. Sit in a shower for free!",1
1171131,2021 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"The first night I used this humidifier water leaked all over my table overnight. I thought perhaps I did not close the tank tight enough so the second time I ensured it was closed tightly. Within minutes of it being on, the surface of my table was wet everywhere. The product has no cracks in it from what I can see. Just a poorly designed product.",1
678348,2017 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I love this humidifier, and it was a great price. Be sure to take it apart regularly and clean it. It gets pretty gunky pretty fast, but it`s VERY easy to clean.",5

665258,2020 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Loud but effective. Warms my bedroom nicely but get noisy when its starting to empty. Its quiet as long as I dont let it get close to empty. Also, if I let it go empty then it has to be unplugged and turned off for 30secs to 1minute after refill or it wont turn on. You will get an orange indicator light that it needs a reset",5
673558,2018 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,it works great from sinus`s.,5
1254415,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"The reason cool-mist humidifiers are popular is because they`re inexpensive. The problem with cool mist is that cold air and cold mist fall to the floor. The reason warm mist is better is because it rises in your environment, with warm air, which makes it contribute to your room`s environment a whole lot more than its cool mist counterparts.",5
1253107,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I purchased this because the air in my apartment gets uncomfortably dry at night in winter, and it turns out the ultrasonic humidifiers are not good for air quality. This was the only other option I found. It does increase humidity, but it has a number of cons: 1) it sometimes spits water out of the front, and the water is very hot! This seems like a safety issue. 2) The power cord gets very hot, like there`s too much current running through it. 3) It seems to only run for about 5 hours even when filled all the way, so unfortunately I still wake up at night with uncomfortably dry air. 4) Sometimes it vibrates in a way that makes an obnoxious sound. 5) I`m not sure what the black stuff is that is always leftover in the water once it turns off, but it`s a little concerning.",2
668752,2019 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This is our second one, both are the same. Worked well a few days. We kept it clean, fresh water. Randomly makes loud mechanical sounds.",1

668077,2018 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This is our 2nd purchase of this humidifier. We loved ours so much we got a second one as a gift for my mother!!! Easy to clean, no filter..... Works best when you use bottled distilled water and not tap water.",5
664364,2019 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Easy to use, works great! I haven`t had long, so I can`t say what kind of buildup / cleaning I might run into. There is a low hum, but its not bad. Sleeping much better with less sinus issues in the morning.",5
1253273,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Keep away from small children. Reservoir tank can get pretty hot. Manual says to use water only, no essential oils or anything. It does have a slot for vapor pads that Vicks brand sells. The steam feels very nice but the mask is kind of awkward.",4
671114,2019 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Easy to operate, very quite. I made good choice by buying this product.",5
1060108,2020 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This inhaler basically saved my whole family with covid. They all said that whenever they woke up in the middle of the night/mornings having trouble breathing, this inhaler helped them breathe again . Definitely recommend. I bought them couple inhalers with the pads and also an oximeter.",5

967693,2020 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Bought this to use in a nursery and it`s definitely large enough to work for a medium sized space. If you have hard water like I do, you are going to see some build up even with filtered water and a bacteriostat. I do see a bit of white powder dust settling in the room after 1 week.",4
925498,2020 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Awesome,5
671262,2019 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This was great at first, but after a few uses it started leaking. You can see the water coming out by the switch which may also be a potential fire hazard. I followed all instructions carefully. Im not sure if it is just this one that leaks or if it is a product flaw.",1
1111340,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I used it 2 times but it leaked and there was nothing that could stop it. I had to send it back.,3
673345,2018 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,great,5
1134724,2021 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I like easy to clean,5
1213046,2022 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Not efficient. The good smell that we insert empties in a few hours and we have to buy more and it is not possible to fill it. You have to be very close to the device to feel the humidity. My humidity calculator notices 2% more after several hours. I dont recommend myself.,2
1104395,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Not worth it. Just buy the cool mist model without the projector. The one I purchased was missing the switch for the projector so we couldnt change between themes. We plugged it in to see how much light it would give off, to determine if we wanted to return it for one with the switch, and the projected image was only about a foot in diameter. Not worth it in my opinion. Ill be returning and purchasing the Vicks filter-free cool mist humidifier without the projector. We already own two of that model and it works great!",2
1253087,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,this product works wonders if you are stuffy or congested. I use it at the first sign of cold and it at the very least shortens the symptoms and makes you feel better in the short term.,5
1169749,2021 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Works perfectly,5
674444,2018 / 07,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Super weak steam - and I bought it twice because I thought it was defective. Really disappointed. Started using a clothes steamer, works so much better!",1
673580,2018 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I`ve used one before so I knew what to expect. It`s very handy and doesn`t take up space.,5
668379,2019 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This humidifier does work. I have to have it on all day with the bedroom door closed though. It is not great fro a large room. I have thought about purchasing a second one to put on the other side of the room. I do not use the pads often but when I do they work ok. However, i hate the way the base and bottom part of the tank get so dirty! it is almost like mold and and color changes. I think it is a pain to clean the cleaning instructions are very complex.",2
929643,2020 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I am unsure if this specific product did anything to help relieve cold/snotty symptoms of my baby. We love typical Vicks products and although I have used this item, I cannot speak to the effectiveness of the product. I do wish it came with more strips than what come in the box.",3
665108,2019 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Great product,5
1135404,2021 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I have asthma, and horrible breathing allergies. Have to use inhalers. When walking outside (which I do most day days) I use this with the Vicks pads after returning home. It works excellent in opening up my nasal passages and soothes my throat from coughing after being outdoors. Excellent product.",5
676357,2017 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,love it this is the 2nd one i own i purchased another one because my son uses the first one now and i love to sleep with this especially in the winter when the heater dries out the air in the house,5
951444,2020 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Love this product !,5
673923,2018 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"so glad we purchased this... during alergy season, and weather ups and Downs use it a lot. only minor hiccup is having to put in the vaporizer smelly stuff.... in our case lasts about 2 nights.

676033,2017 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I have two of these, one for the living room and the other for the bedroom. Dry skin all winter is simply unacceptable. I like to put a few drops of my essential oil`s (5-7 drops) for aromatherapy.

1255149,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Disappointing. 2am Monday morning, I felt like I should write a review because this humidifier is annoyingly noisey. first night of use, humidifier sounds like there is a leaky tap in my bedroom with occasional plumbing and draining issues. is this normal? did I get a defective product? will be returning for refund.",1
1071419,2020 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,everything is good. But just went you use long have white thing,5
677065,2017 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,put this in the steam vaporizer we have for the wife. the strong metholatem smell and helped the wife with her congestion. she really liked it for it really works for her,5
929555,2020 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I bought it and threw it as it is a fake one.,1
1213386,2022 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I have been looking for these filter for long periods of time and lucky I found and works the best for my newborn son.,5
1124478,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,We bought this to add some moisture in our house since the dryness was causing bloody noses in our House hold and it helped significantly.,5
666361,2019 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I love this product. I use the plug in ones that are like a glade type style and I use this one that has a cord. Some people only use one in a room. I go crazy. Right now I have 3 of these and 4 of the plug ins, in our master bedroom (so 7 total) and my two youngest are stuffed up and they hate the Vicks Vaporub so this works great. Plus I love the smell. Even when I`m not sick like right now, I love the smell. Plus a secret, makes hubby not snore just normally (not when he is sick, just his normal self haha). I am pregnant so I will do everything in my power to get some sleep!",5
675494,2017 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This humidifier makes my room so HOT it is impossible to even be in there with it, and that is with the steam on the lowest setting. The room gets hot, but there`s not much moisture in the air, I can use a cool mist and have no problems with dry air, this one, I get a hot room and the air is still too dry. I`m not sure if it`s the heating element that was producing all the heat or just the steam...Pros: This definitely does not create a white film all over everything like the cool mist humidifiers do, so that`s a plus. I used this in a bedroom, so it`s possible that a larger room could withstand the heat generated and not get hot like my room does.Cons: Makes the room super hot on the lowest setting, which does not produce enough steam to sufficiently humidify the space.",2
674378,2018 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Great to use for stuffy noses. The Vick`s smell is strong enough to take over the room and gentle enough to breathe in. Easy to use with no mess!,5
678152,2017 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This humidifier is nice. It`s more powerful compared to my old one. I have to fill up the tank every 8-10 hours when it`s on high. I have this in my bedroom so it covers about 300 sq ft. It`s pretty easy to clean and doesn`t seem to get moldy as often as my old one. I only wish it was a little bigger or they made one a size in between this and the big one. That way I could fill it up only like once a day.,5
1177882,2021 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I bought it for steam inhalation .was not useful and it is a no refund item. So just wasted money,1
674442,2018 / 07,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This product works great..I don`t use the Vicks with it, but the humidifier works in my master bed room which is probably 400 square feet and it`s great.",5
1245345,2022 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"After using this humidifier one and one half seasons, it has become extremely loud. It sounds like an old fashioned coffee pot perking, much too loud for sleeping. This model is also very difficult to clean. It does produce a good amount of humidity, but the design could be much better. I`m now looking for a better model. Signed `Sleepless!`",1
668913,2018 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Love this humidifier. Bought for the bedroom and it is very quiet, no water droplets or puddles that I have had with other models.",5
673354,2018 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I didn`t even have to read the directions to figure out how to use this humidifier. I really like that the hole to pour water into is nice and big which helps to avoid spills. My other humidifier has a much smaller hole and I have to be very careful if I`m filling it up away from the sink. The Vick`s Sweet Dreams Cool Mist humidifier is very quiet, except you can hear the water dripping inside of it, which is kind of relaxing. It quietly hums along pouring out a nice, soft vapor mist. The lights on the top which shine on the ceiling can be turned off if you`d rather not use them.I like small humidifiers like these because I have to keep my babies (my guitars) humidified during the dry, cold winter lest the wood should split or crack. These are perfect for that. I have 2 going and they produce a lovely atmosphere and my skin likes it better too.",5
674600,2018 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,We bought 2. One of them the heating element for the vicks doesnt work. The other one works great. I like that it can do both. It`s way easier to clean than others out there!,4
671912,2018 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This thing really cranks out the moisture! The air in my house is vastly improved, and since it`s a warm mist, it`s not fighting my heat pump. The little channel to add medication is currently doubling as an essential oil diffuser. The water lasts most of the day. Couldn`t be more pleased!",5
1159334,2021 / 08,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Shipping time was slow! Item arrived in a smashed box and plug in prongs were bent. Luckily the item still works. Ordered when my kids had a cold, took so long to arrive that they are no longer sick.",2

925895,2020 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This is an excellent humidifier for the price and functionality. If you have it on the first Low setting, the water will last all night and some for second night. On the high setting, you might run out of water if you sleep longer than 8-9 hours.

672355,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"We were traveling when my son got sick. He had severe congestion to the point where he had trouble breathing. Luckily, I packed this on our trip and whipped it out. We didn`t have any vapo pads however I had some vicks vapo rub with me and smeared a bit on the plastic at the bottom where the vapo pads would normally go. It worked like a charm! After about 20 minutes using this, my son went to bed and was asleep in no time.I love that is is small enough to be travel size. I like that the steam goes directly where it needs to, no hovering over a machine with a towel over your head. I also like that I can use regular tap water. There are two settings for low steam or high steam and I`ve found the low steam to be plenty.This is definitely a must-have for any cold-flu season.",5
1207918,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"After one night of use, I noticed an instant build up of pink mold, had to scrub it down with a toothbrush and vinegar, but it`s concerning, so it must be cleaned after every use? Seems inefficient.",2
1111392,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Its extremely loud and annoying when its on the high setting . Much like a pot of boiling water . Its not as loud on low setting and will last about 3 nights on low but hardly puts put a noticeable amount of steam/ mist .

1190503,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Well, assumed it would be much bigger. It`s teeny tiny. So, because of the size, it`s not strong enough to be effective anywhere. Would not recommend buying.",1
1083557,2020 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This is an easy to use and clean humidifier. Only down side is its not that quiet. Sometimes smells like chlorine.,3
1219133,2022 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This thing is a complete waste of money. You are better off using a pot of hot water from the stove.,1
1219279,2022 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I called Vicks to ask about the flaking of the heating element. They had no comment other that we license our name it KAZ. You have to unplug the unit from the wall when refilling or not using. I see sparks! When I fill the unit at the sink my hands get wet. I need to be sure they are dry when I plug in. So Kas would you like to take to me about a few safety and usability concerns? Free input. Lets improve a few things. Free consultation on my part.,4

667826,2018 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This humidifier is bigger then I thought. I wanted a small one. But could not find one. This was the closest one. I wanted a warm one because my room is always cold. I just got it in today. Have to be careful with kids around it. The water tank doesnt have a lock. So it can easily come off. It is not quiet. Im a light sleeper. So I can not sleep with it on.,3

672948,2017 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Simple to use and provides instant relief of irritated sinus cavities, especially since its been very dry here. Used 2.5 tablespoons of water. It says you can use tap water, but I used my alkaline water instead. The vapor pad (only one included), additional ones will cost about $10 for 20 pads, easily insets into the tray from the back. You have to firmly squeeze the tab a bit and wiggle it out, that piece could use some improvement. Do not put essential oils into this unit, however I did use this with my hydrosols since they are aqueous solution and could replace the water solution. The face part measures about 6 inches long to 4 inches wide, so coverage is over your nose and mouth, resting on the cheeks, chin and forehead. It took about a minute or two for unit to start streaming up a bit, its electric. Its warm, not hot and is not meant to produce a bunch of stream. I would recommend if you are using the pads to start with the lower setting of the air vent control then work up after a few inhalations. Also take slow and deep inhalations for great results. I cleaned the face unit with an alcohol swatch that way the next family member could use it quickly and then washed it well after everyone was done. The unit is not for infants and gives some guidance using for small children. Its a good investment especially during our dry conditions and allergy season. Good compliment to my neti pot which I use more frequently. Its also very portable so we can take this on mountain or desert trips.",4

1134153,2021 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I bought this at Walmart`s in December to go through the winter without dry eyes and dry lips. It puts out a good mist except white dust is on everything. I dislike the bottom fill, because, when you lift the unit out it drips everywhere. Tried to clean to put away for warmer weather ,and can`t pour out all the water after I washed it out. Looks like I will have to buy another one next winter , but will do reserch first. I trusted the Vicks name. Likes ColdWaterMoisture",3
1155761,2021 / 07,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"First use out of box with distilled water, reset light turns on (stops working) each time when turning knob to the higher ouput. worked fine on low output. but I need the high option for sick baby.",2
669938,2019 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Nice humidifier .,4
674018,2018 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Seems to do a good job for a medium sized room. The only thing that I dislike is that water pools up on the bottom and it gets dirty pretty quickly.,4
1250431,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I have two of these one at work and one in my room. Works fine for me. I turn on my humidifier and this at night and it helps especially when you have seasonal allergies and its dry and cold at night. Not really sure about other peoples dissatisfaction with the product. One way to find out if it works is buy one and try it.,5

When we recently ran out of the tablets we used to clean and disinfect the humidifier, we ordered this product recommended by the filter manufacturer.Within 2 days of inserting it into a fresh tank, the new filter was discolored. Over 2 weeks, the filter is completely discolored. This never occurred before over such a short period and is exactly the OPPOSITE of the claims made for using the product.I have returned it.",1

1126121,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Every household needs one of these. This is a nice vaporizer, easy to set up and to clean. It`s nice and quiet and shuts off by itself if I forget to do it. I always set this up in my kids` rooms when they have a cold or if they`re stuffy due to allergies. I like how I can use the vapo pads with it too. It is a great product have for those times when stuffy noses and coughs can keep you up at night. My mom always had one of these when I was growing up, so now I do the same for my kids. Definitely a must have.",5
1133523,2021 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I love this humidifier it did leak before but I was able to fix it and when I fill it up it lasts me about a week on full blast 24:7 thats amazing for this little thing I am very happy with how I didnt have to keep filling it up.,5

671479,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"It has non-stick coating on the water reservoir. Water is boiled out fairly fast, so while you are inhaling some of the left over steam you are also inhaling non-stick coating off gas. If you read about it, the off-gassing kills birds and some people think that it is toxic. Why or why can`t we have the stainless steel reservoir?? I understand that some people do not have any problem with the non-stick coating, personally I believe that inhaling the toxic fumes on a regular basis is just not a great idea.",1
1102209,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Love the warm mist. It is especially good for Covid-19 sufferers as it eases the effects on the lungs. This is a must-have if you live in very dry climates.,5
1252786,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This exceeded my expectations! The color changing nightlight is perfect. Its dim but still colorful if that makes sense. I love being able to point the steam where I want it. It lasts all night and then some! And it still made my sons room humid like a warm mist humidifier. I wasnt sure if it would, but it totally works amazing. Easy to fill, the knob feels nice and you can adjust it wherever you want. Not just low medium high you can customize the amount of mist youd like. I love this thing. And its the perfect size!",5
1125502,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I am often reluctant to buy items such is this inhaler because I assume that I will use it once and put it on a shelf never to be used again. I fully expected that to be the case here and even bought this unit thinking that it was cheaper than the cordless alternative, which I also assumed I would prefer if I liked this one. I have chronic bronchitis and am often congested from mucus in the throat more so that sinuses. First off, does it eliminate my congestion. No, of course not.... but it does provide relief and is soothing and relaxing in the process. I also like that I do not need special bottles of water, which I beleive would have increased to likelihood for it to end up on the shelf. I find that I do not need a cordless version and even like using it on a desk or table. So, rather than condemning it to life on a shelf, I find that I am using it regularly and actually enjoying it. Hmmm. who`d of thunk it.",5
669232,2019 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I bought this thinking that it was for any humidifier but it`s only for a hot steam one so I want to return it and I was not allowed to return it. Due to some shipping reason. So make sure you read the description in its entirety before you purchase it.,1

677464,2017 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"It works just as it should. I like the larger capacity, and it`s easier to keep clean than our cool mist humidifier (I hate that thing).

Our old one recently quit working well, so I was happy to be able to try out this Vicks humidifier. So far, this is one of the better ones we`ve owned. We`ve used it in our kids` room for awhile now, so here are my notes:PROS:1) It is quiet and easy to use.2) It isn`t a water hog; it goes a few days (on low) and there is water left in the tank.3) It is easy to refill the water - use a jug or take the tank off.4) There are no filters or wicks so it is low maintenance (only some periodic easy cleaning).5) You can use vapor pads with it for those nights you`re stuffed up and want a Vicks smell.CONS:I do wish it had a humidistat so it would shut off when the room was at the desired humidity level.All in all this is a great humidifier and we`re using it as I type! Five stars for sure.",5
965749,2020 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I bought this for my sinus problems. With the the first couple of days I noticed an improvement. I woke up without a sinus headache. There was no noise that I noticed. It was so easy to use and clean and the size was just right for my room.,5
675581,2017 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Was VERY pleased with product; however, I did return it b/c grandson moved out after 1-2 uses and I didn`t need it any longer.",5
669529,2019 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I had horrible cough and congestion for about a week before I decided to purchase this for my humidifier. It helped so much. I immediately slept better the first night I used it.,5
1136196,2021 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Purchased February 16th and quit working April 4th. Return window was until March 20th. Not happy.,1
670870,2019 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I used this all winter. Would definitely recommend.,5
669901,2019 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Better than the &quot;new&quot; atomizing humidifiers to treat congestion,5
1244157,2022 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I was skeptical of this product but was amazed and have become hooked on this product. It`s longevity is everything advertised and more.,5
1250241,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Got this little humidifier because the large one my family has has become so noisy - that it was not possible to sleep with it in my room. This model is very easy to use, and lasts about 2 days when the tank is filled to the top. I have found it quiet and has greatly helped me as I struggle with recovering from respiratory viruses and overnight it was easier to breathe.",4

1166310,2021 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Unfortunately it leaked everywhere. Tried it three different times and all ended up with huge puddles of water all around it.,1
1250778,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Someone bought this for me and let me tell you it opens everything up. Now I read some of the reviews and if you follow the instructions most of the reviews would of not of had the problems they encountered. It is strong super strong. It burns your eyes from the Vicks ring but thats what Vicks does it burns your eyes we all know that. Wear goggles and breathe easy friends.,5
930400,2020 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Good,4
1104013,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Its good for the price but to get actual steam is very low. I saw steam coming out it wasnt enough to me mine nor my little ones congestion, I had to use my borrowed humidifier which sorta helped. Its big too so I didnt really enjoy it.",3
1135893,2021 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Easy to use and delivers a soothing mist.,5
673017,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I have been buying Vicks warm steam vaporizers for close to 20 years and in the past I have only needed to buy one each year--we have very hard water and our water softener adds salt to our water (not enough to taste, but enough to corrode the steam mechanism by the end of a winter season of daily use). I have bought most through Amazon. several years ago, Vicks changed the type of metal used in the vaporizer to something that corroded very quickly, turning the water in the plastic water container a dark grey and shedding bits of blackened metal. I have done everything to try to avoid this (taking the vaporizer out when not in use, cleaning it in vinegar, etc.); last year I bought 3 vaporizers to make it through the winter and it looks like I will end up buying 3 again this winter. The worse part of this is that the vapor that comes out carries the metal particles. How do I know? I put it one a marble table in the corner of my living room and the marble has a dusting of black beneath the plume of steam that comes out of the vaporizer. I just read the reviews for a sunbeam vaporizer that has stainless steel rods. I think that it is time to try their vaporizer!",1
674927,2018 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Works great for a small space...as described :),5
1017159,2020 / 07,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,My cat loves it. Bought it for his asthma. He loves his showers.,5

1127558,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Its very hard to clean and even with changing the water almost daily it gets mildew inside thats very hard to clean out. After about a year of frequent use in the bedroom it has started to make an awful noise like something might have happened to the motor, but the base with the motor hasnt ever been moved so we think its just giving out",5
676725,2017 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Very nice quality and a great price for this. Much bigger then I expected it to be. The top of the lid has dual scent pad slots for the Vicks pads to be inserted and it also has a Vicks medicine slot for the liquid to go. There`s a nightlight on the top as well. Gives off a decent amount of steam. Very happy with this product and it came just in time because we`re all sick!,5
669953,2019 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I really enjoy this item its steam is absolutely strong for a big size room. conforting my sinus.,5
668912,2018 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Hmm mine is not working sad I only use 3 month and it already broke but Im so in love with this marching,1
670922,2019 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This is a good product but my last 2 Holmes models humidified the room a bit better. I now use both because one is not enough. The Holmes unit is old and dying so I will use both for good results.,3
1114456,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Warm air comes out but at a slow rate even at highest settings. Works better with liguid Vicks then the tabs. OK machine just a lower vape then hoped for.,4

676232,2017 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"It works as designed and yes, I had to put some salt in the water to get it to operate. After using it for about 3 nights, and hearing it auto shut-off in the early morning hours, I wish I had bought the larger capacity that would last till morning. I`m 68, this probably would not be a problem for a baby or a sound sleeper. It works as it was designed to work.",4
671801,2018 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I love this humidifier. I use it in my kids` room. I also use the PureGuardian Antimicrobial Aquasticks with this and I rarely need to clean it. Those things work great and even help the filters last longer. I only go through 2 aquasticks and 2 filters each winter. I can get 3-4 nights` use out of one full tank of water. And I like that it`s not too quiet, which is good for my kids. The white noise of the blower actually helps them sleep. I only gave it 4 stars because the blue light on the knob is annoying. We like our rooms very dark when we sleep. I wish we could turn that off, but we put electrical tape over it for now, so not really a big deal.",4
668812,2019 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I have had this one week and no steam!!!! I will be returning this item tomorrow. I used a neighbors vaporizer before i purchased this and it would fabulously. Not mine!!!!,2

1128918,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"My mom when I was a kid and me all my adult life have been steaming my sinus`s. This machine makes it so easy. My sinus pain is gone and I can breath. I have to use it twice a day because I am a mucus making machine, but it will pay for itself as I no longer need over the counter medication. It is a good buy. I think kids would like it, as I would have liked it as a kid.",5
663772,2019 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,So far it`s worked well. I just put in a calming lavender vapor pad but it`s not been long enough to smell it.,4
1126794,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I had a different model Vicks humidifier that was on its last leg. We had it for 7 years and barely took care of it so I am confident in the Vicks brand and that is why I chose another.This model is a cool mist which provides moisture without adding heat. Additionally, it hasn`t created any condensation in my room unlike the other did after 2 hours. The little scent pads are much nicer to use compared to the cup option for adding liquids as the cleanup is easier.I have been using distilled water to avoid any mineral build up. I`ve come to realize that I NEED my humidifier to work, so I am taking care of it. It is not that easy to clean to water tank completely. If any chunks get in there it will require some twisting and shaking to get them out through the hole with a flat surface around it. With proper care and regular rinsing it should be fine.Very quiet and has a light on the dial so you can see if it is in on the dark. Will run for about 14 hours on medium before refilling.",5

677064,2017 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I find it`s too thick so it doesn`t completely evaporate. It leaves a thick residue that I have to soak up with a tissue every time I use it in the steamer cup. I bought the Walmart brand and it seems to work better. It`s thinner (and costs less) so I don`t have an issue with it creating a buildup.,2
670327,2019 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Purchased this for my husband who had trouble breathing and snored at night. He can now breath and gets a better nights sleep and I don`t have to listen to him snoring anymore!,5
1059986,2020 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,So so,3

I have been using warm mist humidifiers and taking decongestants that helps. I was hoping these vapo pads would work, but they don`t. I can barely smell them and they barely last for 30 minutes. You are better off using a combination of essential oils of eucalyptus, lemongrass, & tea tree oil, in a diffuser. Works better and cheaper in the long run.",1

Overall not what I was expecting, a little disappointing",3

On hands and feet feels like they are stuck/ frozen and fell asleep and the pins and needles, but times 10 and it builds until you can warm them up. But how do you warm up throat and lungs? Hot apple cider, cocoa... last night, the neuropathy upped its game and told my brain I wasnt breathing at all. Scary! Held my hand up and could feel the breathing, could feel it through my nose, but painfully- neuropathy there too. Grabbed the steamer... and it warms up the throat and lungs, calmed my brain to get the signals I was breathing just fine. Scary and so grateful I have this machine! Helps so much!

This is my second one, they are really easy to use, stay fairly quiet even with excessive use, and last a long time. The base can be a little difficult to clean with some of the mineral buildup because I have hard water but if I leave it on with a mixture of vinegar and water that usually takes care of it. As for replacement parts they dont sell just the tank which is a bummer. Dont drop it while its full of water! Highly recommend!",5

665376,2020 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I`m only writing this review as a precaution for anyone planning to buy this. I bought two of these. One for my room and one for my son`s room. I was setting these out to test on the kitchen counters. I did have to add a little bit of salt to these, but during the 15 minute period where they tell you to wait for steam before adding salt, one of the humidifiers spat scolding hot water at me and burned my foot! I took about 2 cups of water out, thinking maybe there was too much (it was at the MIDDLE of the water ledge) that must be too much. I made sure to fill the other one up UNDER the ledge. I also now keep the one that sputtered in our room and the other in my son`s room since the other one started right up perfectly after I knew our water needed salt like the other one and the water level was correct. Make sure when you are setting these up, do not stand directly in front of them. I`m glad my son wasn`t standing in front of me, as he was standing close by when it happened. He is only 2 and it would have directly spat him in the face had he been standing in the wrong spot at the wrong time. As far as performance after all of that, they seem to be working alright. I did have to add 1/8 tsp of salt and stir the bowl. Started right up after it didn`t want to steam the first 15 minutes. I also would like to add that the &quot;nightlight&quot; is this tiny little green light that looks like an indicator light to show that it`s on. So, don`t buy this for a child`s room thinking it`s going to illuminate the bowl or something. It gives off zero light. I don`t know why they describe it as a &quot;nightlight&quot;",4

663888,2019 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Im giving this one star based solely on my experience with customer service. I have purchased 4 of these over the years. Im currently using 3 (one broke when my husband dropped the tank). Two of them are making a noise like theres a card hitting the fan in the motor. Its loud and irritating but the humidifier still works fine. One of them is maybe 2 years old, the other one is one week old so I know its not an issue of needing a newer one or build up of hard water or anything. I called customer service to see what I could do to make the noise stop. Their solution was for me to cut the electrical cord, take a picture of the cut cord and email it to them. Once they received this they would send me a new one. Im sure this is so they know you arent trying to scam them out of a free humidifier. I have several issues with this. 1. I need a humidifier in my kids rooms. Its December and theyre all sick. I cant go without one until they decide to send me a new one which could take at minimum 2 weeks I was told. 2. The humidifier isnt broken. Its still making the room more humid. This seems like a total waste. I dont want a new one. I want to fix this one. 3. How do I know this wont be happening with the new ones they send me since it seems to happen with all units. They said I could wait for a prepaid label and then send my humidifiers in to them and then they would send me new ones once they verified mine are faulty. This would take even longer than the cutting the cord option. Im so irritated with the whole thing. I guess Ill wait until summer when I dont need a humidifier and try to return these for new ones that will just end up making the same noise. Do NOT buy this humidifier or any other Vicks humidifier for that matter if you dont want to deal with outrageously unhelpful customer service.",1

I have had issues in the past where the area around my humidifier would get wet. I never had a single issue with this unit doing that which was great!6. My only concern was when I would fill it, I would have to tip it to the side to get the water flowing into the base initially. If I didn`t do this, I`d come back 12 hours later and find that no water had moved from the reservoir to the base/into the air.

1201568,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Overall, I like it. My biggest gripe is that it doesn`t shut down when empty, but it is a manual and not digital so pros and cons. Pros is that analog appliances would typically last as long as the mechanical parts would allow. The directional spout is convenient as well as the large opening to fit in smaller hands to clean out the tank. But there is a center obstruction (tunnel way) that make getting to the back difficult, so you`d have to use a flexible baby bottle brush (easiest I found). It is a tad awkward trying to gently settle in the full tank as the grab handle is only in the top back and the rest is just smooth slippery wall. I clipped my finger tip a few times already. As with some of the other reviewers, when the tank is empty, it`ll just keep on...no steam because it`s analog so you`ll have to be vigilant about that water level.Honestly, I never tried the aroma pad warmer. I am mainly happy that I no longer have a mildewy wick/filter to constantly change out. I`d buy this again.",4

674770,2018 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"We have the older version. As has been posted, salt is needed for this device to work - BUT the amount depends on your water type. Our water is usually well water (very hard), but half the year it is diluted with river water (not so hard) so I start with a half a teaspoon of salt and add more if needed. Add too much salt and fill the tank (to the full mark) and it spits water! (So don`t fill the tank until you know how much salt to add.) Because the water is hard and boiled, the minerals in the water (iron, calcium, magnesium, and salt!) are left behind and form iron complexes (the grey-black stuff) and other compounds. These (1) coat the elements (and decrease steaming), and (2) collect (grey-iron stuff for us) on the bottom. To reduce this problem, you can add some citric acid (I use 1 teaspoon), but this only delays the problem. So, either use soft water or clean it weekly. To clean the elements, I add 1 tablespoon of citric acid to a large jar of water and let the center section soak during the day.

1224538,2022 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Broke within the first 10 hours of using it. This humidifier was kind of wonky from the beginning. However it worked until it didnt. In the middle of the night I hear water pouring on the floor so I get up to check and its the humidifier. I properly filled it up, closed the lid and placed it on the base so why would it leak? Anywho, kinda disappointed it broke within the first day of having it.",1
1133143,2021 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Stopped Working after one tank. There was a lot of plastic debris in the tank. Like the motor was coming apart. I was looking for a cheap humidifier. This was cheap but you get what you pay for. I since returned it and bought a beer quality one.,1

It was making no progress at all until I shut the door, which they tell you not to do. The daily maintenance requires 10 minutes or so, but it`s a pain, as the base part requires cleaning, but you can`t submerge it, of course. The weekly maintenance instructions involve white vinegar, a bleach solution, complete disassembly, and about an hour of your time futzing around with the thing every WEEK.

The first night i used it my throat felt a lot better. I also suffer from dry mouth at night. So Ive been using this at night still. In the morning my mouth doesnt feel as dry anymore! I love how you can controll the amount of mist that comes out, other humidifiers in the same price range dont have this option. Since I no longer have a cold I just use it on a lower setting. Otherwise the room will become too humid. Theres also a slot where you can put Vicks vapor pads. I used a few ,theyre okay. I honestly dont think theyre worth the price. The humidifier itself is worth every penny in my opinion. Ive been using regular tap water because Im too lazy to go out and buy distilled water....it works fine. Oh lastly this humidifier releases cool mist not warm. So it can be used in the summer without feeling gross because it wont heat up your room.",5

On unit #3 it was purchased November 2018. 2 weeks ago the water canister cracked on it also. Another table to the dump. Well, I decided to call for warranty as I still had the receipt. I WAS TOLD THERE IS NO WARRANTY ON THE CANISTER!!!! ONLY WARRANTY IS ON ELECTRICAL PARTS! Well in my opinion if water leaks into the electrical parts this is a fire hazard. These units should be recalled! KAZ is the manufacturer of my last unit. The customer rep. kept apologizing &quot;oh I am sorry&quot; but was not at all a genuine sincere apology.

672102,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This machine works well. We`ve used it with and without the vapor pads and so far my only complaint is the cost of the vapor pads. They should be rechargeable or something by soaking them in the Vicks liquid.The unit is easy to clean. I clean it once every one to two weeks and sterilize it each time with vinegar and bleach as instructed. I have had no mold issues in any area of it and the mist output is excellent at whichever setting you have it on the dial. It is intermittent on low, which is to be expected since it is trying to output a lesser amount of mist.If you place it on a wood surface I recommend having something under it to catch any water drops as you remove the canister to refill it. The lid can be difficult to remove, especially if you overtighten it after filling. This can be helped by filling with room temperature water so the canister lid and seal do not expand or contract with temperature differences.It does not have a nightlight in the general sense of the term. It`s power light on the output dial does glow green when it is on and can not be turned off without turning the unit off.Lastly, it is not silent. It has a white noise sound it emits as the mist is being cycled out. It`s not loud but it`s definitely audible.",4

677553,2017 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"After nearly 6 years going strong I decided to buy a 2nd one, per doctor`s suggestion. I now have the new one in my bedroom and the old one in the living room. Usually I run it on the low setting and it will last almost 24 hours on one fill. The green/orange light on the switch is not annoying at all (and I need one of those sleep masks to stay asleep if there is any light whatsoever). My throat/sinuses are not so dry when I wake up in the morning now. And while it isn`t really big enough for the size of my living room, it`s better than nothing. I use vinegar to clean it, letting it soak for a couple hours. I tending only to clean it at the end of the season, it would probably be better if I did it once a month. I do use one of those little mineral absorbing pads on the heating element and that has helped tremendously with the scale buildup. I change those weekly.The noise from the steam evaporation is not bad, I consider it white noise and barely notice it except when it stops and I know it needs refilling.Should either of these ever fail I would not hesitate to buy another.

I figured I was just unlucky and got one of the humidifiers that doesnt fall into the most category. The opening in my humidifier is much too small, as other reviewers have both indicated and shown in their pics with the same type of opening. However, Ive seen other packaging in the reviews where it says (and shows) works in ALL humidifiers. It will fit in the top-fill tank of the humidifier Im ordering for the whole house, but not for the smaller one in the bedroom. They need to update all of their packaging to reflect that it fits in most humidifiers. Better yet, they could indicate the size of the tank opening in which it WILL fit. Real or not, even fish need tanks in which theyll fit. ",3

676866,2017 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Humidifier ran for maybe 2 or 3 minutes and error light came on. The product does not work as it should and you should not have to monkey with Humidifier for it to work out of the box. This is not an uncommon problem from what I have read. When it did work for those few minutes it produced little to no output. Look elsewhere for a working Humidifier.,1

982693,2020 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This has helped me with my sinus issues. I recommend it for people who have a lingering problem with sinuses and think it would help them. Easy to use and good quality. I trust Vicks for good results.,5

673223,2018 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Size - it ran for a long time before we needed a refill. It is very quiet. The amount of mist is perfect - we didn`t get water on the floor at all. There was a sample scent pad with the machine - it mentions not to use it with young children in the room. My husband gave it a try and he felt it didn`t make too much difference for him. But it was nice to have the sample one to try. The humidifier by itself was mainly what we wanted anyways.,5

I bought mine at Walgreens in about 2009 and I see that the same model V745 is still around. It still includes three $1.00 coupons for Vicks products. My coupons expired 6-30-2010.

675239,2017 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I have used this for a week and so a good product for the price. I have very hard water so weekly cleaning is a necessity. The process is fairly easy but somewhat time consuming.,4
676237,2017 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I`m having more problems with my sinuses, and I was hoping this might provide me some relief. It works wonderfully! I was shocked, though, at how hot it actually gets. You should not use this product or give it to someone who cannot support themselves. You may have to adjust yourself during treatment to prevent burns. At first, you may put your face into the mask, but as the water heats up it gets so hot that you need to lift your head up to keep from getting burned. I keep the inhaler on the minimum steam setting.My only complaint is that those Vix Vapopads fall out easily and are rather annoying to place. They are very potent, so you only need one--though the holder can accommodate two.Because this item does get so hot, be certain not to put cold water into it after it has been heated up, and to keep it away from cool temperatures. Also, make sure the water doesn`t totally evaporate during use, and don`t use it for more than 15 minutes. You have to wait for it to cool down before you can clean it. I would think it would be best to also follow their advice on upkeep, like cleaning it with vinegar after every 10 uses. If you are putting it away, make sure it dries thoroughly first...and look under the par that holds the Vapopad. The underside is easy to overlook, and it gets quite a bit of moisture.",5

925852,2020 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This type of vaporizer generally works fine. But the particular one I got had a small defect: the hole at the bottom of that black part was blocked by a thin film. I guess it was from defect molding. I used a small knife to cut this thin film off the hole (half finger nail size) before it works normally.,3
983803,2020 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I have to keep adding salt to make it work and the steam that comes out as minimal compared to other Vicks steam producing products I`ve purchased.,2
671245,2019 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I have a very dry apartment because of the heating system. This works perfectly when I need to determine if I should run my humidifiers. My parents have the reverse issue so they use them with their dehumidifiers.,5
673840,2018 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Quiet, easy to use/fill, small (so easy to find places to put it), cool mist is nice (and safe for a child), multiple speed settings (the highest will use the entire tank in almost one whole evening). Do not leave water sitting in it too long unused, itll go stale and stink.",4
1214358,2022 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This product is great! It will last you all night and then some. Highly recommend,5
677193,2017 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Very helpful and soothing.,5
678003,2017 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Helps keep a calming essences in a sick ones room while working as a night light. You can chose also how strong you chose the vapor to release itself.,5

669135,2019 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"my son`s room is large, so i use 2 of these to add moisture. we live in connecticut where it is very dry in the winter. these humidifiers make things so comfortable. there`s a noticeable difference in humidity between his room and the rest of the house. i like that there is a handle on the underside of the water reservoir so that it is easy to hold it while filling it. one tank in each humidifier is enough to get us through the night on the high setting.",5
967140,2020 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Have one, bought this for a friend. Works well and large opening that makes easy cleaning.",5
1032866,2020 / 08,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Im so grateful to this product. I was able to sleep and breath better after the purchase,5
672526,2018 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Best humidifier weve purchased. Very easy to maintain and clean (as directed in instructions with vinegar weekly and dilute bleach monthly.) Love how silent it is, the ease of not having to change filters. No white residue left either on furniture.",5
672038,2018 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Does what it says but be very careful not to move it while it`s running. I burned myself when moving it and the boiling water spilled on my hand.,3
1213650,2022 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Love the calming and soothing effect,5
675674,2017 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I ordered 2. One was perfect. The second was used and dirty! It was retapped and had amazon tape all around it.,1
1160446,2021 / 08,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"My 10 months daughter was sick and that helped her so much, Im glad we found it. Its not waist of money, you have to have it",5
674647,2018 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"A touch on the expensive side but when the kid is sick money doesnt matter, helps him sleep through the night with congestion, these fit directly into the port on the Vicks humidifier and last 6-10 hours of powerful medicinal smell.",5
664423,2019 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Both the water reservoir and the unit itself are difficult to clean. The water reservoir cannot be opened with a wide enough opening to clean or scrub the inside. A soot residue eventually builds up inside the unit and can be seen when the water reservoir is removed. Flushing out the soot is difficult since the parts of the humidifier are hard to remove and some pieces need to be unscrewed with a screwdriver. I wouldn`t buy this again and would look for a humidifier that can be more easily cleaned instead.,2
1113447,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This worked great for a few months, but now makes a horrible loud whining noise when turning it on. I have to turn it on and off quite a few times until it stops making the noise. I can`t try to turn it on once my daughter is already asleep because it is so loud that it will wake her up. The projector is also not lined up correctly, so all of the projections are so blurry you can barely make them out. The humidifier also needs to be pretty high off of the ground if you need to turn it all the way up, otherwise the floor will get soaked.",2

1190947,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I like using the Vicks pads, which helps me breathe better; at my age (95) every minute counts. It keeps the air clean in my living area. I have two of the units in my home.",5
1191340,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"it didnt take much for the steam to start coming out like i wanted it, i originally got it for my 8 month old",5
1111110,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Its great and I use for everyone in our house. I place it in our leaving room and it goes through out the room. I love how you can use pads or liquid vicks for it. I even gave my to a friend for her baby and went and bought another. Love the price not expensive in my budget and works amazing.,5
675070,2018 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I have been using this daily for several months. I use distilled water in it so it doesn`t scale up or get rust in it. It works perfectly & shuts its self off when it runs out of water. I love the bonus of the steam cup on the top. You can use Vicks vaporsteam, but I have been using it to diffuse essential oils. The cup pops out easily so you can clean it and place more oil in it. It holds a gallon of water, and I wish it came in a larger size, but overall it does exactly what it needs to do.",5
668785,2018 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Have owned this vaporizer in the past. Air in house was so dry my eyes were sticking to my eyeballs. So got this good standard. Operation is quiet and output is gentle stream of steam. No spitting. No dampness on furniture or textiles.,5
667569,2019 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I purchased the Vicks Warm Mist Humidifier from a local retailer thinking it would be a good product since it has the Vicks label on it... boy was I mistaken. Within a couple of weeks the steam became extremely weak and the tank would last longer and longer every night... as expected there was buildup on the heating element, which I attempted to clean off by putting vinegar in the reservoir.... this made a slight difference after running a whole tank of vinegar/water through. I attempted to clean it manually by removing the top shroud of the humidifier, would have worked great, but the design prevents you from being able to clean it effectively. This thing is designed to be replaced yearly! The tank began to crack in less than a year without ever being dropped. The plastic is just that cheap! If you want to set this on top of wooden furniture make sure you put a large pan under it, this thing leaks like a sieve. Would highly suggest staying away from this humidifier, especially considering there are other, cheaper options that are of much better quality.",1
671170,2019 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Easy to fill, good amount of moisture put into the air.",5
672556,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Works effectively.,5

1034742,2020 / 08,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Perfect for a large room,5
1164844,2021 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This is a plastic cup you pour hot water into. It does not create any steam. Waste of time and money.,1
677364,2017 / 07,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Could never get it to spit out steam. Even when adding salt.,2
672700,2017 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,It will do what it says on the box. The tank must be removed and turn upside down to fill it with water. It should have a cap on top to fill it up. Real quit to run all night. Puts humid air out into room. Yes do buy this one.,5
1243794,2022 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Way cheaper then getting at the local store. Same great quality.,5
1047653,2020 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"These work just the same as the original VapoPads, a light lavender scent. I would purchase again.",5
1085519,2020 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I used 15days and everyday cleaned up with vinegar and I can`t clean up that part.,1
676727,2017 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"So far this seems to work very well. When it`s on high, the vapor really shoots out. This replaced an old model that barely worked, so I just might not be used to the power. Very quiet and uses water efficiently.",5
668594,2019 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Worked well for a few colds. Then one night it started leaking. I went into my toddlers room after a night of it running and it leaked probably more than half of the tank all over his dresser ruining it and all down to the wall outlet. Disappointing doesnt begin to describe it. It also started forming a pink sludge inside that was impossible to clean.,1

677808,2017 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I have cool mist humidifiers for the children but I have always loved the warm ones because you can add medicated liquids. This has been especially helpful for me at night because I just turn this on and my cough almost goes away and I can get some sleep.,5
1251745,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Didnt work. I had to return it. Maybe it it work it would have gotten a better review.,2

1102039,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I bought this is 2019 and first year it worked fine but now it gives low reading compared to other units I have and even placing it next to humidifier does not do anything, I put new batteries in it and still the same. Don`t waste money on this unit. I am sorry I bought it now. Example: another unit will tell me humidity is 45% this one says it is 29% and no way to get it to read better. Frankly I have have seen other units that read better for less money so do not wast yours on this...",2
674535,2018 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,we bought this humidifier cause our 5 month old was sick and plus night light was a plus. we use it every night. we love it and worth buying wen have lil one sick.,5
1134183,2021 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,These were an add on item for a humidifier I purchased. They did not fit into the tank! They are slightly too large to fit into the water fill opening.,1

1032420,2020 / 08,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I like having this but just wish the vapors were a little stronger!,4
1219769,2022 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Picture is deceiving the fish doesnt fit in Vicks tank I even melted fins off to make it fit still didnt.,1
1228726,2022 / 07,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This product helped me open up my badly congested nose but I would say expect this to be only temporary relief for a bad cold or infection that involves congestion. It did help break up mucus faster and help me somewhat manage life while be badly sick but other than that it is extremely helpful for just normal non severe allergies especially with the menthol pad added in the tray,5
1126747,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I formed allergies recently and these have been helpful in keeping my nasal passage clear throughout the night. I appreciate not waking up stuffy.,5
666222,2019 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Lavender Vicks is the best. It really helps clear your sinuses and calms your nerves. It is so soothing. Although the regular menthol vicks is potent, lavender is just as potent with a softer smell.",5
1251480,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Works great but a little pricey,5
1031455,2020 / 08,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"1. You aren`t supposed to rest your face on the clear cup per the instructions. anyone saying it comes off didn`t read the instructions. even then, I can rest my face on it pretty easily2.This produces about as much steam as maybe 3 mugs of tea. this doesn`t product HUGE clouds of steam. sitting in a hot shower room or sauna is better, but this is portable. I can use it at my desk while typing like right now!the biggest factor here is convenience. Do you want to go into a hot shower room for 25-25 mins to clear your sinuses? If you`re sick the shower will have more benefits than just clearing your sinuses. If you need your sinuses cleaned from bad air pollution, nearby forest fires, or allergies this is a perfect little device for use at your deskOne last thing is this does make steam, it is hot. pressing my face deep into the cone is very hot, *almost* enough to burn me.overall I am satisfied with this product.",5
1062327,2020 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,It works but is sometimes too harsh and can burn easily.,4
1126005,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Glad we have this now. Given we are inside so much now we need to monitor the humidity as we are having more dry eye and sinus issues. This plus a war mist humidifier did the trick. It a good product. Really nothing to do but read the number. There are no settings except c/f.,5
675030,2018 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"So, I had two brain surgeries in April and they went through my nose. Well, after a month long hospital stay, I came home but I was suffering. My nasal area still had packing in it. I was due for them to vacuum it out but I needed relief in the interim. This helped so much. I didnt use the packets but just water.",5
966594,2020 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,We bought this back in October and it broke in April. I`d like to think you could get more than 6 months use out of it. It was also difficult to clean.,2
668615,2019 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I like the product, Im disappointed with the poor quality of the plastic. The photo attached shows the cracks in the housing which have developed over normal use (never dropped). Same happened with my first Vicks Steam Inhaler V1200.If they improved the build quality, Id have given 5 stars.",3
676721,2017 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Love the cool mist. Not at all noisey. Last maybe 2.5 nights before refilling. Which obviously depends on your sleeping duration. The vicks vapor pads do seem to loose scent quickly. Other than that great product.,5
929000,2020 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I am totally disappointed with this humidifier. I purchased it about 2 years ago and just started using last year around Oct/Nov. It was great at first but the filter becomes saturated quickly now & the water is overflowing tremendously out of the humidifier. Ive been trying to locate my initial purchase information because I should still be under factory warranty & more than likely I purchased the protection plan.I purchased a less expensive Vicks humidifier for my sister in law a couple of years ago & she loves it.,2
670471,2019 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Im very satisfied with Amazons customer service but the product not so much. The fan has one speed, so if its on low or high output the fan is louder then every other humidifier Ive owned. Full tank of water lasts about 9 hours on 75% setting. Try another brand, fyi....the seller I bought from was prime but will not take returns :( smh",2
1073692,2020 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Feel good for my kids when winter come with heater in house,5
927941,2020 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This is great as a Humidifier when working. The control level dictates how much water will be evaporated per time period, and the great thing is when it runs out of water it knows to turn off. All in all a great humidifier, the only reason I didnt give 5/5 is because when refilling, you have to remove the top half from the bottom; in doing so its near impossible to not have water drip out.",4
1160142,2021 / 08,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Initially, I did like the humidifier as it was helping me to sleep better. After a bit, it became kind of annoying to have to clean it every week and add water every other day or so. That maybe par for the course though. Recently the fan just stopped working. It actually does work if I hold the base upside down, but that doesn`t help. I have to try to find the box or figure out if it under warranty bc I think it should work longer than 6 or 7 months.",2
1142601,2021 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I love this product. You just put a little bit into your vaporizer with water and turn it on. It helps clear stuffy noses and sinuses. I keep extra around for when the kid and I get sick.,5
672306,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I recently researched a lot of humidifiers under $50 because our house is so dry (winter and heater) and we needed 3 (1 for each bedroom). I bought 3 different humidifiers--Vicks Warm Mist Humidifier with Auto Shut-Off, 1 Gallon, Model V745A, TaoTronics Cool Mist 120V US Plug Ultrasonic Air Humidifier with Mechanical Switch and Low Water Protection, 11.8 x 8.7-Inch 3.5L, and Vicks Filter-free, Ultrasonic, Visible Cool Mist Humidifier for Medium rooms.This one is the best of the 3! The room this one is in actually feels a little humid! All 3 helped our noses but the cool mist ones do not provide the same level of humidity. The TaoTronics one makes the floor around it super wet and will be returned (and I`m going to replace it with this one).My only complaint about this one is that the tank is smaller, so you have to refill it 2x/day to run it on high.",5
1253494,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This works like a charm....have nothing bad to say about it. I really like the control knob...I can turn it up or down and that helps a lot.,5
671435,2018 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"A life saver in winter!!! Ease to fill, to clean and NO FILTERS!!!",5
664099,2020 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I would say 5 stars, as it works efficiently. Mine leaks really bad. In the morning I have a huge puddle of water on my floor and under my babies bed!!!!!!! Its horrible! It worked great the first few times I used it. Im really really unhappy with this product.",1
1201915,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This is so much better than the recent &amp;quot;improvements&amp;quot; to vaporization devices. It is old school,just water and electrical heating units. It is designed to wear out, so only expect one seasonof use, but it is cheap so who cares? The newer design, expensive &amp;quot;cool&amp;quot; vapor units get pluggedwith lint and grime anyway, so you are buying filters and cleaning them endlessly. They recommendusing distilled water, but that gets expensive real fast. Just use tap water, and replace it every year.You may have to put a little salt in the water the first time you use it to get steam.",5
673179,2017 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Something very wrong. After every use there these bluish and black hard rock type chunks and flakes inside the tank and a bad odor. Have cleaned out several times. Still does it. I will never buy from Target again. Must have been a previous return or something.,1
1153786,2021 / 07,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Worked great in my master bedroom. Be sure to use distilled water and you wont have any issues with mold and it will make cleaning so much better.,5
670077,2019 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,They work well and do what they are supposed too.. the vicks pads don`t work or else they were old...I just put peppermint oil on them and that works fine.,5
675798,2017 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I thought this would operate like my much older vaporizer that I needed to replace. The amount of vapor put out seems so trivial that I`m not convinced that it is accomplishing anything. It does operate a long time without refilling, but again, maybe that`s part of the reason I`m not crazy about it. I have been using it, but in concert with my older model.",3
1200219,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Works awesomely. I got this for my 9 month old son to ease his nighttime stuffy nose and it worked perfectly. Love that I can plug it up and doesn`t need water. I could do without the bright green night light that has no way to be turned off. I also don`t like that those little pads only last for 1 round, I`m buying box after box of those Vicks refills.",4
671484,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Really like the auto shut off!!,5
667663,2019 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,At first I thought it wasn`t working. I noticed the bubbles at the black stopper moved when I walked on the floor toward it. So I tipped it back and forth to get the water to go into the bottom part. Then it started running. I have not had to tip it anymore. Next time it`s completely empty I will just put some water in the bottom first. So the auto-shutoff works too. I put softened water from my tap in it. I don`t get any white powder on stuff. I have been running it at the maximum output mostly on for a week now and it works awesome. I don`t see any buildup inside of it yet. Do note that it may likely make your gas burners(stove top for me) run a yellow/orange flame as there are more minerals in the air. I thought something was wrong till I found that info. online. Shut if off for a couple of hours with the dry furnace running and the flame is back to blue. Hopefully it`s not causing problems or less heat out of my furnace which is downstairs. The cold air returns may be drawing enough of those floating minerals to have an effect there. That`s partially why I am only running one and only in the room I am in. It`s a hassle to move it around but worth the moister air. So far so good!,4
1059091,2020 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I used to use a hot humidifier but wanted to try the cool one. I like the light cool mist and the noise level is very low.,4
675496,2017 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"First off is not quite at all, can not sleep with it on. When it is on it hardy makes any difference. I would return it but they have no return policy, that tells you something about there product right there. Do not buy waste of money.",1
677162,2017 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"We love this warm mist humidifier! It provides just the right amount of moisture in our dry Utah air, especially for when my kids are sick. The Vicks liquid medicine that you put in the top to diffuse is amazing and a life saver. I would highly recommend you purchase that to go with it. The only downside is that if you have hard water, you will need to be careful to de-mineralize the unit often as it can cause problems when it builds up (very easy to do; just soak in vinegar).",4

663835,2019 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Steam inhalers provide quicker and better relief than ingesting all the acetomenophen, doxylamines and hurting your liver. these OTC ones just suppress the mucus.

668364,2019 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This product does what is intended to do. I do not care for the glowing light, as I am a light sleeper as it is. Also, theres no off switch! The plug that is in the room is not easy to get to, so a switch would be perfect.",3
983462,2020 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I used this humidifier all winter in my bedroom. I thoroughly rinsed it out (all parts) with hot water ever 3-4 days -- whenever it was empty. I did not bother going though the cleaning steps in the instructions except before I was ready to store it away for next winter. I never saw ANY mold or mildew anywhere on the humidifier. I suppose it could have been there invisibly (?) -- but I did not see (or smell or feel) anything suspicious. I am very happy with this product!,5

675597,2017 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"It produces steam but the reservoir doesn`t hold a large amount so it gets used up pretty quickly. As far as whether or not it helps with congestion, it does - for about 5 minutes and then everything clogs back up. Not sure it`s the machines fault, it`s probably the limits of what steam can do. Nice idea but doesn`t have the long lasting effect I`d like. Can`t speak to other ailments like migraine since I got it to use for congestion so could work for other things.",3

669281,2018 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I like that it`s a simple-as-can-be product. I read a lot of reviews before buying a humidifier and all of the ones with unnecessary bells and whistles seem to have one thing in common. It`s the extras and the computer necessary to work those extras that break down. There`s really no need for a digital display or wifi connectivity. I don`t need to connect to my humidifier with bluetooth, or change the color of it`s light to match my mood. What I do need is a humidifier that works and has a high capacity. It certainly works just fine so far and the tank is nice and big. With no computer or fancy display, I don`t see it having much chance of breaking down any time soon. I do recommend using distilled or at least filtered water to keep mineral deposits to a minimum.",5

1112003,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This humidifier has been great for the winter and any time my daughter has a runny nose. My only issue is that it leaks at the bottom when being used.,5
1142958,2021 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,These fish are much too large for my vaporizer & cannot use. I prefer the balls.,1
669039,2018 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,It works well putting moisture into the air. The high setting runs for about 8-10 hours. The pool of water that is heated needs to be cleaned regularly as minerals in the water don`t evaporate with the steam.,5
1206595,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Required a lot of water to function through the night- about 3 litres. I returned it for that reason and it was also difficult to clean. A lot of residue left over after just one night of use.,1
665387,2020 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"01/23/2020I`ve owned the older models including the Vicks 4500, V745, and others (i.e. SereneLife PSLHUM80, AIRCARE EP9 800s).Summary of improvements compared to previous models and other vendor models:- SMART HEATING ELEMENT(HE) LOCATION: The HE is inverted/elevated, this prevents water deposits from sticking to it if placed on the bottom of the tray. I hated cleaning the older models, I just threw them all away and got 2 more of these. WHOEVER CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA, I LOVE YOU!- MUCH EASIER TO CLEAN: So easy to clean and take apart, all the parts are thought out to make cleaning/disassembling a breeze. Everything is smooth, no crevices or little holes with springs or any area that doesn`t allow a nylon brush to remove any deposits specially if you have hard water, and a nice wider tank opening to clean with a bendable brush. It took me about 1-2 minutes to clean compared to 10-20 minutes.- SIMPLE: Simple to use and no wacky lights beaming at night, multiple controls etc. Only one control with 2 separate volume settings, even though at first I thought it wasn`t flexible enough to allow me to control the flow I ended up realizing that it is not required to have 20 control settings like other products. In this case the less to deal with the better.-GOOD 3-YEAR WARRANTY: Compared to others at 1-year.----------------------------------Potential Improvement: A wider tray/tank model that holds more water for less refills, this one is nice but a 2nd option would be nice for those that don`t mind carrying a heavier water tank to refill it less often.---------------------------General Recommendations- Clean your humidifier at least once a week following directions. Which includes vinegar brushing heating element, and putting vinegar in the water tray. Also diluted bleach in was for the tank to kill any germs before you start seeing colorful stuff inside the tank.-Humidity Levels- Humidity levels should be between 38% and under 44% , under 38% you will get more colds, germs fly on dry air much easier, also your skin and respiratory tracks dry up and you get sick. Above 44% there is the danger of making it too humid and letting mold grow in your house, and other germs that make you sick.----------------------------------Answers to some of the 1 star reviews:-&quot;Buyer beware of sediments&quot; This should be changed to buyer beware that you probably have a well with acid water treated with an old softener or lack of, that makes it hard, and also have high iron content. That combination gives you sediments, and rust when the acid corrodes the iron in your water and also your copper pipes. Get your water tested and fix it, it won`t be perfect but better than what you`re dealing with. Also clean your humidifier more often or use purified water.- &quot;The worst humidifier ever made - DO NOT BUY-&quot; : John probably works for one of the other companies I referenced in my review and is trying to lose sales. He was not specific about what was so wrong, so looks like a bogus review to me. - &quot;Defective. Leaked. Do not buy this product&quot; The water tray is a one piece solid plastic tray so it won`t leak, the tank has a rubber seal that might have been damaged by putting too much bleach that`s my guess, I had this issue with one of my old humidifiers and I had to throw it away but it was my fault I broke it. Regardless the manufacturer warranty is still good and you can return it for a new lid or tank.-&quot;Constant Refilling&quot; Major exaggeration here, I`ve had mine in both available settings and water vaporizes between 8-9 on the highest level, and 10 to 11 on the lowest. But I agree that a bigger tank would help like I stated in my improvement section.-&quot;Horrible Experience&quot; &quot;It kept shutting down&quot; It auto-shuts off when empty, so if it was shutting down with water in it then it might have been a defective unit. Not sure why you waited 2 weeks to get the replacement delivered if you tested it within the Am",5

I hope that they will let me retun this because it does not work. I also wanted to mention that Walgreens is charging $61 dollars for these.

The hot mist also helped the skin around my eyes, nose and mouth that was getting dry and chapped from the combination of brutal cold outside and moisture sapping gas heat inside.But the heated mist that soothed my sinuses made my lips very, very uncomfortable. The mist didnt burn my lips, but they felt uncomfortable enough that I was hesitant to put the mask too close. I tried covering my lips with cloth, but that blocked the mist from getting into my nose. I tried turning down the intensity of the mist, but my lips still felt weird. Just a little bit of sun and heat can give me a cold sore, so I was afraid of experiment too much with ways of protecting my lips from the heat.So good for the sinuses but I dont like how the puffs of steam makes my lips feel.",3

1218693,2022 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I suffer from intense seasonal allergies which usually leads to sinusitis and Im miserable until mid summer. However I decided to get this for my boys who were also suffering from congestion. This was a miracle worker for all of us! I love it the most obviously- we love the Vicks shower tablets but this is more direct steam right where u need it most. My littlest guy is 4 so its a tad warm for him but he holds his face away from the mask further. But it definitely helps him too! I went on Pinterest and found a post on how to reuse/ make your own vapo-pads so thats what Ill be doing. I love essential oils so as long as the unit continues to perform we will really get great benefits with this. The unit said it came with a free pad but It wasnt included in the box for mine. Oh well if you suffer from allergies or have a head cold/congestion - this is an excellent temporary solution to give you relief.,5

1111131,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Smells like chemicals, I was hoping for more of an essential oils type smell or like vicks vapor rub.. that like menthol type smell. Didn`t even finish using the first one I opened, debating if it is worth trying to return the rest.",1
1214842,2022 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Love it!,5
1207444,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I am so upset. I ordered one of these thinking it would ummm actually work... so I requested another one and I received it and the second one wouldn`t work either the first one wouldn`t blow the humidity into the air and the second one dumped out all of the water on my floor within 15-20 minutes. I would like a complete refund....,1
1114823,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"worked once,never able to get Steen out of it again.",1
671675,2018 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,it turns the water black,3
1170651,2021 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"It worked! My infant daughter slept better than she has in weeks with much less congestion. But it is a bit bulky and hard to clean. I also couldnt handle the smell from the scent packet so we took it out, which is a good option to have.",4
1086717,2020 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Generated steam is not hot at all. May be a child can use this but not for adults.Very frustrating!,1
664462,2020 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Got this as a gift. The noise level is very low. I am a very sensitive sleeper. Any noise will make me awake. But with this in my bedroom I have no problem to sleep at all. Also it is very easy to use. I love no filter feature. Really dont want to change filter. Good product.,5
1127011,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I`m very impressed with this product this was my first time trying it and I love how it holds enough water to last throughout the night and the size is so perfect it will fit anywhere and it has great features too I can`t do without it.,5
1135906,2021 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Works well!,5
672257,2017 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I bought this a little over a year ago. And I plug it in and it leaked everywhere. It was quite and worked great. I just wished it lasted longer.,2
672122,2017 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Works great! Doesn`t hold bacteria like most others do. Easy to clean! Highly recommended.,4
1201527,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,The scent is terrible 1/10 would recommend. The return window is not the typical Amazon standard so I cannot even return them for a better/ different scent. Dont purchase!,1
1220033,2022 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,It was working good but after one week it just stopped working Ive tried everything cleaned it very well made sure the water was completely drained out everywhere and the machine still wont work. Just took a photo to give you an idea how big the machine is its definitely on the bigger side and holds more water.,3
677405,2017 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Works really well. Have had it for two years now, and predict to use it again next year. Fairly easy to clean and easy to carry the water tank. The light show is a cute perk. Humidifies a small room perfectly. Quiet.",5
1179627,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Vicks humidifier has a large water tank so it last all day. My house is very dry in the winter and this humidifier is helping to keep the air from being so dry.

671654,2018 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Powerful, easy to use, and easy to handle.",5
677312,2017 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This isn`t my favorite humidifier. I bought it to get me through the winter as it has been super dry. I have been running this in my bedroom, I fill it before bed and by morning it is totally empty if it is run on high. The whole thing does come apart pretty easy to clean but some parts are more of a pain to clean than others.",4
673435,2018 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Good one,5
677689,2017 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Excellent,5
678226,2017 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This works really well in my Vicks humidifier. I have tried many other brands but this one works the best (for me). It helps keep my sinus clear especially at night and it cuts down any sore throats that I may have in the morning.,4
668548,2018 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,It worked,5
1154750,2021 / 07,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Not much steam, had to add salt all the time. Got moldy quickly too",1

1179157,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"If you look at the picture above it shows the beads are at least filled up to the blue line on the inside of the fish. Mine isnt even half way filled they really said, you get what you get right not impressed",2

672021,2018 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"It didn`t last one month. I clean it twice a week by letting it soak in vinegar, and scrubbing with an old toothbrush. See attached photo, the heating element seems to have cracked and I am not sure if it is safe to operate anymore.",1
664790,2020 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Easy to operate,5
671842,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,The steam is very weak. It does not have the heating element and relies on the hot water that should produce the steam. The instruction state that no boiling water should be used and as result there is no real steam.,2
1126150,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Works great!! No more nosebleeds!!,5
664458,2020 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Water lasts more than 12 hours when on medium setting,5
1086583,2020 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I had to return this product because it did not work when it was plugged in. No air blew out. It has been 2 weeks and I still have not received my refund from this vendor yet!,1

1016103,2020 / 07,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,The original Vicks item works great.,5
674284,2018 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Nice,4
664897,2020 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Hardly any vapourized air comes out. It`s as effective as placing a pot of water lower than simmer and hoping to get moisture in the air from that.,1
1124273,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,No more scrubbing! Just through this guy into you humidifier and all that build up disappears!,5
1103841,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"once it heats up the constant vapor is nice and hot, very good for sinus problems",5
671141,2019 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,The base started leaking all of the water out after 4 months when I would turn it on. I don`t feel that it ever raised the humidity level in my room when it did work.,1
665337,2019 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I love this humidifier! Its my first hot steam one and I find That it works really well. Noticeably different than the cool air type. Its a large size and can diffuse for 12+ hours on high. The auto off feature is also amazing. Considering buying a second one to keep my entire apartment humid!,5
1125326,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,It works as advertised. No issues so far!,5
674469,2018 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This thing is a piece of crap. Ive gone through 2 of them now, thinking the first one was a dud. Ive had the second one for a couple of months and it worked fine until recently it started leaking puddles, so much so that it caused my carpet to get moldy! There are no apparent cracks nor damages to the unit, it just leaks profusely! Another annoying thing about this humidifier is the amount of crap that builds up on the heating unit from the water.",2
667577,2019 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I ordered this for my granddaughter. She says it helps and works well. So far so good.,4
676196,2017 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I read the reviews before purchasing and was very disappointed. This machine leaked all over my hardwood floors and on to an area rug. I returned it.,1
669267,2018 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Just having for only a few months the unit stopped working, another piece of crap sold thru Amazon. Do not purchase Vicks Filter free Ultrasonic humidifier. Wish I could give it zero stars. Should have bought at Wal-Mart so I could return it without hassle.",1
671635,2017 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Nice,5
1201911,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I use only distilled water, never used the pads, and descale regularly. After 12 months and a couple of weeks this device no longer turns on.",1
928366,2020 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Works great. Not super quiet, but not loud either.",5
669759,2019 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,A needed product!,5
1245744,2022 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This humidifier is very good and practical for the se in a small bedroom. Mine was leaking therefore I had to return it.,3
1047911,2020 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Can hardly smell them in , and they don`t be last very long.",1
1146640,2021 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Will return. Produces tiny stream. Worthless. Was sadly surprised. Vicks has always meant quality to me in past. We have 2 physicians in family. Will advise against this purchase.,1
668161,2018 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I was suffering from a very bad upper respiratory infection and nose bleeds until I purchased this. Soon after receiving this, my symptoms were noticeably reduced (medication helped too of course). I would definitely recommend also purchasing the Vapor Pads as well to maximize the benefits. Ive left the device on for nearly 24/7 in my 850 sq/ft apartment and have had great results. I would highly recommend this for anyone fighting a nasty cold or upper respiratory infection.",5
1114254,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Love this stuff! When Im all congested and my nose is runny I plug this in at night and I can breathe better. The vapor pads work great and give off a long lasting vapor anger in the whole room.,5
671491,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Works great!,4
1230261,2022 / 07,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Gets moldy inside very easy no matter what precautions I take. Feels like I blowing mold in to my infants room.,1
931637,2020 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Much more accurate than other humidity monitors I`ve purchased.,5
663824,2019 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Shuts off constantly and says it`s &quot;empty,&quot; regardless of how much water is in it. There is no way to fix or get around this, it`s simply a piece of junk. Especially if you`re counting on this for relief... Buy something else",1
665546,2019 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Better prices for something you use once and throw away. Scents last most of the night.,5
673059,2017 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Overall the product works fine, but when the water finished it goes red but gives a burnt smell. So not sure if it`s going to last long and has to be a little careful when you go to sleep. Fill the tank and then only go to sleep and only out on low setting. High setting empty fast and you don`t want it to be empty in the night due to the burnt smell issue. Filling water requires a little bit if strength as you need to fill, turn it on it`s head and then place a weird move that you need to master. If you drop with the water in it it will break 100%.",4
1114021,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Although this was one of the items under the &quot;you may also like&quot; portion of the advertisement, these pads are useless for some of the Vicks Vaporizers including the one I ordered.",3
668972,2019 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Great,5
672314,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Works well. For my machine, the vapo pads work a little better. But the steam is a close 2nd :)",4
1112366,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"As the title states, this was our second purchase of this model. Our first one still works after 2 years and this one was purchased for another room. The unit is quiet, shuts itself off if it becomes empty, works excellent and is a great value for the price. This is easy to refill and makes no mess in doing so. If I were to need another or to replace one I will buy this same model again.",5
1105177,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,great product but a bit difficult to clean,4
1062647,2020 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,went bad after using few months. Had to order new one.,1
673614,2018 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Very simple to assemble and use . Ive only had for a week. So far no problems. Very quite. It is already helping with my Bronchitis . Highly recommend!,5
674882,2018 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Is very small, you need to add water on daily basis.",5
723963,2019 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"For only a handful of small tablets, it was far over priced. One in the humidifier did not produce much smell, and using two at a time they run out quickly. Not a huge fan.",1
670526,2019 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Perfect,5
1035139,2020 / 08,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This is helpful specially in current COVID-19 situation. It helps greatly in OR avoid cold and cough.,4

671851,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Works well for a couple days then fizzles out... this is the second one I purchased on a recommendation from a coworker. It worked great for a few days and now itll work for about 30mins before the auto shut-off kicks in and turns it off, every time I use it. I dont recommend it.",1
1085426,2020 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,These were just ok for me. The scent isn`t that strong. I would have like it to be stronger.,3
967826,2020 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I Love this because it helped me.,5
1207880,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"When this is working, it`s fine...but getting the water into the holder, and getting it back onto the stand, is a major headache...you have to align the holder exactly to get it on, and with the weight of the water, it`s very hard...I like my oither one that you just fill from the top MUCH better...really sorry I bought this.",2
1134349,2021 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"It worked well for a couple weeks, then I somehow ended up with the calcium buildup despite trying to decalcify the water I put in it. No problem right? Unfortunately it happened again a few days after cleaning it, and hasn`t worked since. Not sure why cleaning it again won`t fix it.",2
671527,2017 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I`ve been using a standard small room humidifier that wasn`t helping me at all and I have terrible allergies. I found this one and I crossed my fingers and hoped for the best. I was worried at first because I couldn`t see any steam. It`s such a fine mist that it feels like cool air is being blown on you. But boy can I breathe now and my throat doesn`t feel like I have sand in it! I live in a studio and this thing handles the entire place. I would recommend this to anybody. If you handle it PROPERLY, there shouldn`t be leaks. I`m actually surprised by the negative reviews on here. The mist also comes out the front, not the side... And the locking mechanism for the water tank is secure, there isn`t a place for it to leak, I`m starting to think people are on the wrong product",5
665074,2020 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,this was a gift,5

676631,2017 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Just bought this today for my daughter`s persistent cough. It has been 3 hours and her cough is almost none existent.

I have a studio apartment that`s about 300 sq feet and it works wonderfully, I am pretty sure it would work just as fine in a bigger apartment.

676274,2017 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"The humidifier worked fine for an year and stopped working beginning of this winter. I have also cleaned the humidifier as per the instructions provided every 8 weeks.The warranty is 2 years however, the customer support team has requested I sent the item to them and pay for shipping.

1083553,2020 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I have it on the night stand to improve my air quality in winter. I appreciate that I don`t have to unplug the power cord which is hard to reach for me. For refills I just grab the water storage container on top and take it to the bathroom to fill it. You have to hold a towel or just a hand underneath because the bottom part came out of the water and will drip a little.,5
676236,2017 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Works. Could be easier to refill with H2O.,5
675409,2017 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I love this so much. I was trying to find something that I could put in my kid`s room when they`re sick and they won`t touch it or play with it at night. My three and four year old just think it`s a regular night light and pay it no attention. Even when the smell is gone I have put essential oils in it and use the pads again.,5

667592,2019 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"It`s a nice compact humidifier good for a small room which is what we bought it for, however we noticed a few issues very quickly: Within a week of using this humidifier we noticed that cracks were forming in the tank, and its not like we toss it around or anything, just move it from room to bathroom sink to fill up. When we take the tank off the humidifier it leaks like ...a LOT. I would expect a few drips to leak out when lifted from the base but it pours out at least a cup of water. We also noticed after a week or so of use that pink mold was starting to form in the nozzle and up the spout...places that I couldnt reach to clean! I clean the base and the tank with diluted vinegar every week like the instructions say and we still got tons of pink mold. Even worse is now it seems that its not eligible for return...so we are stuck with this piece of junk.",1

1141744,2021 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"We love our starry night humidifier! We did not purchase ours on Amazon but I wanted to submit a review because it is our favorite compared to the others weve used! It is quieter than most other brands and so easy to clean. We like to get the little vicks cleaner fish that you can drop in to keep it clean for 30 days. My son is 4 and we use this all through allergy and cold seasons. He loves the different projector settings. We alternate them each night for variety. The light from the projector is low, but not too low.. perfect for night time in my opinion. We also use the menthol and sleepy pads that go with it. These products have helped my son tremendously. Especially this month, as his seasonal allergies have been the worst this year.",5
1111801,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I used this vaporizer one night, and it worked well. By the second day it wasnt producing vapor anymore- even after changing the water and replugging it in.

1085066,2020 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I`ve had no issues with operating this device, which operates quietly and does a good job of moistening the air in the room.I doubt I will buy another one, however. As others have noted, you need to clean this unit regularly or use distilled water to prevent scale build-up. The first time I went to do my weekly clean was eye-opening. The instructions don`t illustrate the procedure, and Vicks has plenty of videos online, but none that I can see that cover this model. You have to loosen a screw to release the &quot;cooling chamber interlock,&quot; and oh, by the way, we didn`t mention there are two little springs hidden under there that may fly out when you do so (pretty sure one of those now lives in my sink disposal). Putting it all back together also required my wife using her smaller hands to get that little screw reseated. All in all, way more frustrating to try to clean the unit than need be.",3

1125497,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I use this vaporizer in combination with a space heater in a small room to create a hot yoga environment. It gets the job done rather quickly. Puts out beaucoup steam.,5
669629,2019 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Great product! I love that you can insert the Vics scent pads and direct the mist where you want it. It does the job perfectly for my sons` room.,5
1155023,2021 / 07,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I bought this for my son who has almost constant head aches he was steaming by holding a towel around his head by the stove over a pot of boiling water. I thought this would be better and safer and less costly to use. It works fine,5
1128776,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"We live in an apartment and our furnace has a humidifier, but the air is always too dry. I don`t know how to adjust the furnace. We have been using the vaporizer in my son`s bedroom to add moisture to the air. I moved it to the hallway and it seems to be powerful enough to humidify my son`s bedroom, the master bedroom and the hall. It is quiet. It is a little difficult to fill and put back on the base. When I fill the reservoir in the tub, the handle part gets water in it too so when I turn it upside down, I must take care to get the water out or it will spill on the floor. Also, it is difficult to line the reservoir up with the base. I finally put a mark on the reservoir and on the base to line them up. Also, it is a little difficult to close the door for the vapor pads, so when I change them, I have to fiddle with it a bit. I use a &quot;cleaning fish&quot; to float in the tank. I think it has activated charcoal. I only clean the unit at the end of the winter season. I have had it for two years. I don`t think I purchased the unit from Amazon, but I purchase the vapor pads from Amazon.",4

The only thing that works is the nightlight. There isn`t even an on or off switch. I wouldn`t recommend it,2
670971,2019 / 07,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I absolutely love these humidifiers! We got one for our first baby when she got her first cold and then it became something we used every night for her. We got one for ourselves too. With our second baby we made sure it was an essential and got a third one. It gives off colorful lights that our first loves to watch as she drifts off to sleep. It has a white noise effect which helps by husband and our second sleep better. It keeps the room cool but not wet since it`s an invisible mist which is my favorite part. Only downside is the lights don`t spread across the whole ceiling like as advertised but that`s okay, since it`s still a nice enough night light for our kids.",5

671621,2017 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"So, I ordered the wrong item. I actually thought I was ordering the one with the cable plug. However, I decided to keep It and was not disappointed. Its small and compact, can probably fit easily in any wall outlet, or behind furniture. It comes with about 4-5 refill pads. The scent was noticeable in the room in about 30-45 minutes. The smell of Vicks was pretty strong, although my husband said It just smelled like bleach to him. There are 3 different settings for scent control. (Low, m&eacute;dium, high). There is also a small green light towards the top of the device. The light is always on as long as It is plugged in. This is titled as a waterless vaporizer I dont think It works like the vaporizer at all, I honestly think It works more like a Glade Plug In but with a Vicks scent. Also, the recommended usage for the pads says its good for only 8 hours on high. That kind of sucks when you think how much youll be spending if you replace the pads according to those guidelines. Not too sure if its worth It.",4

1127069,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] So we are using this for a while new purpose. My daughter bought a chameleon and it needs steam to keep the humidity level in the cage at a good temp. This works great! Of course we don`t put the Vick`s in it for the chameleon. We would definitely recommend this for individual use and let use.,5
669213,2019 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Its good. Just too noisy sometimes.,4
952271,2020 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Our unit worked well for a few months then water started leaking from the bottom one day. We clean it every day and this still happened. I unscrewed the bottom section and there is a hole that has melted directly into the plastic beside the heating element. There are also two screw sections underneath the heating element that are melted. We are very lucky it didnt catch fire!,1

674436,2018 / 07,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This product works Fine only on highest setting. Turn it just a pinch lower and bam! you have it on the lowest setting (though the dial shows it should be on medium-high). Appreciate the notch to carry the tub. Wish they would have made the product so that the water drains out easily. I have to shake it in all sorts of directions to empty the tub. Why make that lip which prevents the water from easily emptying?? Fine product for the price.,3
670654,2019 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Loved this humidifier! Used it for my sons nursery for his first cold and it ran all night (12 hours) on high. It was so powerful it went through the vents and humidified the whole house. It never left any condensation either which I was worried about! The set up was fairly easy and there is a place for a vapor pad on the side too. It even comes with a sample vapor pad!,5
1139915,2021 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Im on day 2 of using this and so far Ive noticed Im not waking up with as dry of a nose. I love how much water it holds so I dont have to fill it up every night.,4

1047405,2020 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I have been writing reviews for humidifiers for years and keep saying the same things. Eventually one of the manufacturers is going to listen and make a fortune with a new design. But, this one isn`t it.It does everything right, gives an ample supply of moisture, does so quietly, and isn`t difficult to set up. But why can`t these companies produce a humidifier that can be disassembled and placed in the dishwasher? I have three or four humidifiers that I rotate through and allow to dry out after cleaning. But even doing this, they eventually get build up and moldy deposits that you just cannot get to with the way they are designed. If you could take it a apart and put all the pieces that hold the water into the dishwasher, leaving the electronic portions out, it would last ten times as long. I guess they don`t want to do that because then you won`t have to buy another one so quickly.So, as far as humidifiers go, this one is a good value. Performance and price are both solid.

Same as you get from boiling water on the stove, but its safer and more steam is produced and concentrated. I breath it up my nose for 2 minutes 2-3x day to cure sinus congestion, headache and the clogged ears that occur from the sinus congestion affecting the ear`s tube in the neck. I add a bit of pure organic sea salt. It helps kill germs and makes more steam. Also good for the winter in homes that use dry heat. Dry heat dries out the nose, sinus and leads to infection, congestion. The warm steam vaporizer (also is a humidifier) prevents dry nose, sinus.These Vicks Warm Steam Vaporizers are the best. Much better than cool mist, spray brands. Vicks also lasts a long time. My old one was 3 years old. I dropped it, got the wires/contacts wet, corroded, so I bought this new one.

Quiet: no more than a small fan noise with occasional gurgles as it reloads water. Easy to read water tank: we remove it and refill it while it runs. Been pumping 3 gallons per 24 hours into the air, on High. And not dangerously hot. Plus, no white dust. Bought a second unit and used the $1.50 coupon inside the first box.

1084158,2020 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This takes 6 min to get hot which is ok, once it does, it works well and has an adjustable steam flow and supports vicks pads which really help clear out my sinuses.The challenges:* the markings wear off after uses (minor)* even if you don`t overfill it, picking it up almost always causes spillage of burning hot water.* it`s challenging to use on a table unless it`s the right height.* the unit is so light and the power cord is so stuff, it`s easy to hit the power cord and that knocks it over or spills it, also causing hot water in places you don`t want it, especially on skin.Bottom line:I like this for the price, but due to the drawbacks I`m willing to pay more and find another model because I`m becoming reluctant to use it due to the burning water. I wish Vicks had another model that was built better and safer for more money even and I would buy that, but so far I`m not seeing it.",3

It says that it is good for medium sized rooms, but it is less effective at humidifying the air than many small room humidifiers I`ve owned, for the same size or larger spaces. It also gets dirty ridiculously fast, and can`t really be cleaned effectively. I can leave vinegar soaking in it for hours, and it still won`t get clean. The buildup also has a dramatic impact on how effectively it pumps out water. The build up gets really bad even after only 3-4 days of use. I don`t understand why it`s so much worse with this humidifier, but it is. I think cleaning it out once a week is a reasonable schedule, but that isn`t enough for this one.I`m giving up.

1061956,2020 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Plusses: Small and easy to use on a tabletop. Easy to fill. It generates better concentrated steam than boiling in a pan. The clear face surround is soft and comfortable on the face, and it`s easy to rest one`s chin on it. Vaporub pads are a clever idea and work easily: other reviews say to reuse the pads with your own essential oils, eucalyptus or otherwise, which seems feasible.Minuses: Small water reservoir, so only lasts so long. Sometimes it can be difficult to separate the top and bottom halves to access the water reservoir, like the rotational latch snags, and must be forced. The clear face surround smells like plastic, exacerbated when heated by steam.All-in-all a well-designed, easy to use device with some room for improvement.",5

1200721,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Best thing ever! Bought over a year ago and still works great! Such relief when you don`t feel good.,5
1181701,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I didnt realize that this item wasnt electric (my fault for not paying attention when I purchased it) but the directions say that you cannot use boiling water and hot water doesnt provide steam. I started to send it back but decided it wasnt worth the effort.,1
1169774,2021 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This seems to help people feel better when they have a cold. Been using it for years and don't think there is anything better for a good nights sleep.,5
1111963,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I bought this because I have a problem with dry mouth when I sleep. I figured this might put a little moisture in the air for me. I had it pointed right at my face on high, about 3 feet away. I couldnt tell any difference with dry mouth.Like several others, it leaked big time. I fixed that myself with a patch. Stop leaking but still no moisture in the air.Complete waste of my money and my time.",1
1250499,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Easy to use. No filters to replace. Top fill. Only issue is how often you have to refill it. It says to use tap water, which most advise using distilled, however I`d still use distilled especially if you have hard water.",5

I have never had a humidifier before that ive loved. this one is easy to use. ive been using it nonstop for days and days. its been a miracle. read the instructions... you DO need to keep it away from wood and walls, OR you can open a window ( which i have done to prevent any damage to wood or walls since my humidifier is on the nightstand) over all great product. will definitely be purchasing a second one for my kids room.",5

1160275,2021 / 08,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Unfortunately I don`t have an option to give below one star and super sad part is can`t return it. I`m totally disappointed. I can`t get enough steam to relax the congestion. Garbage product not recommended.,1
1226101,2022 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I got this humidifier when I was pregnant with my son. Since then I had my daughter. I have been using it all their lives. My son is 11.5 years old and I just ordered another one. I would not buy another kind. I made that mistake one and my furniture got burnt mark from the water holder. I highly recommend!Efficient, quiet, and lasting! Very good quality!",5

674585,2018 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Outputs steam very quickly and the water lasts for a long time. Suggest closing the water tank with a small dome. There is slight risk of hot water coming out from the sides if this is tilted or not kept level.,5
674773,2018 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Love the size of this product so that it can sit on nightstand by the bed. My dislike about it is the glowing green light indicating its on so I can get the room 100% dark and I can hear the motor in it running from the room next to it. Just wish it was more quiet.,3
1177770,2021 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Awesome night light and humidifier all in one. Very quiet.,5
669602,2019 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I purchased this April 1 and on May 5th it stopped working. I plugged it in and a full force of vapor cane out ( more than usual) and then it just went off. Unplugged and plugged in again and nothing. It worked great when it worked. Would not recommend this item.,1
1207097,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I really liked the Vicks vaporizer. I put out great steam and provided great humidity.

667925,2019 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I got this when suffering the flu and every time I`d fall asleep my throat would get so dried out. It made a huge difference in my ability to sleep. The first few days I used it with the Vick`s pads which were a nice addition. I`ve since been using it non-stop without any problems. It`s bigger than I expected and does take up a good chunk of counter space but I`m really happy with it.,5
674682,2018 / 07,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Works fine until now it starts to build up mold inside cant really clean the tank either!!,2
671529,2018 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I love this humidifier and Amazon was the cheapest place to get it. Our family all got the cold/flu and with the winter heat blowing, our house was too dry for everyone to heal. After a month of sickness I ordered this humidifier. We ran it in the bedrooms at night and the main part of the house during the day. There was major improvement after just 3 days. I totally recommend this unit. I love that you don`t have to pay extra for filters. It is super quiet and very soothing.",5

Also be aware that it is nonrefundable. I didn`t realize this and I had a struggle to get refunded. Normally, I wouldn`t fight my oversight but this is a defective dangerous product. I`m very unhappy. Take my advise and find a safer product. --- Shame on you Vicks for not caring about a burned loyal customer. Decades of buying your products down the drain.",1

1086196,2020 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Product came with no free Vicks pad and looked like it had been opened,4
668623,2019 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This humidifier is perfect for the bedroom, cold winter winds here in western Arizona along with the house heat causing dry conditions cause allergy issues for even the seasoned locals. Ran this eight hours during the night and still had plenty of water left in tank and slept good with no sinus issues in the morning. Tried the Vicks pad and it does emit the vapor quite well. The only issue for me was the steam control knob seemed to emit the the same flow on low and high, only a minor issue as long as it works. In my opinion the suttle machine noise was more soothing to me instead of being a distraction. Been using it both at night and daytime as needed, after three weeks no issues so far.",4
1231655,2022 / 07,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Worked great until both units stopped after about 6 weeks. Now cant returned it for exchange or replacement. ,1
665193,2020 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Just picked this up from Target and when I opened the box, the humidifier is disgustingly dirty with black soot covering the steam hole (see pictures). Either the product was a used-and-abused product being sold as new, or the manufacturing process has terrible quality control. Either way, the black tar can`t be good for health. Highly questionable sourcing by Target.",1
672824,2017 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Bought 3 of these - love he concept. No filters, warm mist, etc. Have to add salt every time since I guess our water has low mineral content or something - that`s not a huge deal since now I just fill old milk/juice jugs and put the salt in ahead of time. Black chunks in the water every time I swap the water which are just mineral deposits. The insert needs to be cleaned weekly - I read to soak it in full strength vinegar by letting it sit in it for 10 minutes. You can open the insert and scrape off the minerals and rinse out the black cover.It only runs for a few hours though and always leaves two inches or more of water behind. Must be doing something wrong. Might switch to Vicks Warm Mist Humidifier with Auto Shut-Off.",3
678277,2017 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Helps so much with head and chest cold symptoms and discomfort.,5
669490,2019 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Its nice and quiet and the perfect sized humidifier for a small space (bedroom). Has totally changed the sleep I get at night.,5
967825,2020 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,It creates the hot steam but not good for children. When I was using it for my 3+ years son the hot water spill out of the container ( water storage bottom part and white mask part has really loose attachment) and burnt his hand. It is more than 1 month that I bought this so can not return but dont want to use and burnt my sons hand again.,2
668734,2019 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I didnt notice a difference in humidity even though i could see vapors coming out of the machine. 2 weeks into using the machine it began to leak. I cannot figure out where it is leaking from but it consistantly leaves a puddle on the surface it sits on. Now the fan turns on when i turn on the machine and no vapors come out even when i have the machine on high. Im very disappointed in the performance of this product.,1
1104607,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Wonderful smell to have at night while you sleep.,5
677151,2017 / 07,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Nice vaporizer that is quiet and compact. The steam is just the right amount to keep you breathing well and moisture in the air. It is easy to clean and simple to use. Adding some drops of your favorite oils to the little fabric pads is a nice way to brighten up the essence of any room also.,4
668876,2019 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Works great. A little smaller than the previous one we had which is great because it takes up way less space.,5
1190863,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Initially the product seemed fine. a little cumbersome to add the water but I guess thats the way it is with any mist devices.The first night it was bubbling andgurgling and kept waking me up. The next night I put extra water in and it seemed OK then the third night it didnt create any mist, then I would fill it more turn it on and off and it would work, then it wouldnt work, then it would work ..:and I had no idea why it was or wasnt working. It sounded like it was working but the mist would not come out of it probably 50% of the time.I kept a hygrometer right near it and it never seemed to make the humidity go up either.Not worth the effort so I am returning.",1
672147,2018 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Works better than the pads. More consistant in intensity, pads are sometime dried out. Liquid is easier to adjust strength.",5
678394,2017 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I absolutely loved this humidifier. However, after a few usages it started making a loud noise as it was going out. It made me nervous to cut it on while making that noise in my childs room. Unfortunately, my child has pneumonia and I now have no cool mist humidifier to help offset the congestion. This will be going in recycling now and I am back to purchasing a new humidifier. :(",2

1171035,2021 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"The first use, we vaguely smelled the vapor. Since then, we dont even try any more because zero vapor is released. Im, honestly, surprised its even sold. Total dud and waste of money.",1
677511,2017 / 07,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Good for a few months, then toss. Think of them as disposable units if you live in hard water areas. You can take them apart and clean them up, but the electrodes just fall apart in hard water.",3

672814,2017 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"It is perfect! But it comes at a price. It uses 260Watts.

1254196,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"In a ridiculously stupid redesign, they made the top of this unit all curvy. The problem with this is that you need to turn the water tank upside down to fill it, but of course it won`t sit flat anymore. It`ll still stay upright--it won`t completely tip over--but it sure wobbles like crazy. It`s a little harder to get at the heating element on this version to clean it, too, although it`s kind of a hassle either way. You do have to clean it, though, or it`ll build up a bunch of scale and get worse at producing steam. All in all, I guess it`s okay--it does the job it`s supposed to do. I`m just frustrated that they redesigned it apparently without thinking about the mechanics of actually using the thing.",4

The water in my Vick`s humidifier was getting smelly and slimy 2-3 days after cleaning, so I bought a few of these to last the rest of the humidifier season and they seem to be working.

It does hold a good amount of water, basically lasts through the night, and really puts a good amount of water into the air. The best thing about it is its simplicity. It is awkward to carry when full, and the reservoir has odd ridges so the residual water doesn`t completely pour out. The little black things in the water do not come out easily by pouring, but the few that remain don`t seem to be a problem. The nightlight isn`t a problem for me as I appreciate the reminder that`s on and running.",4

671238,2019 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,the humidifier does provide warm moist air - and is not noisy; the turning of the top to gain access to add more water is challenging and alignment is important - recommend marking to make easier; tough item as my box had NO padding to keep it from bouncing in shipping box and works....,5
1253422,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Plastic chemical smell had me up coughing all night. Just wasted money since you can`t return item. Vicks has a cheaper model that`s much better.

981830,2020 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I really underestimated this Vicks vaporizer. Ive always had problems with congestion. Especially in the mornings. I picked this up ar walmart one day and i thought this is so little. It doesnt take up too much space and it actually works. You can smell it within a few minutes. My room is pretty big so it doesnt get around the whole room. But, it does do the job. It turns on a little green light so you can easily spot at night. You do have to seperatly buy the vaporizing patch that does inside. It is not messy and takes up little to no space. I do wish that it automatically turned off or had some kind of setting to be turned off after a certain time. Overall, this is a good buy and works great.",4

676872,2017 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Ok humidifer, tends to make quite a bit of noise on the high setting like rapidly boiling annoying noise which is really distracting if using it at night. Otherwise it does what it`s supposed to.",3

1072798,2020 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Do not buy this product if you plan on having it in a room where someone sleeps. It has a very bright blue light that can not be turned off. Blue light is shown to interfere with the production of melatonin so it`s the worst kind of light to have if you are trying to sleep. This is very lazy product design. Why would you make a humidifier, which a lot of people sleep with, that has a light you can`t turn off. And why would you use the light color that is the worst possible color to sleep with. I returned this product and I wish I had read the other reviews before buying that complained about the bright blue light.",1

This product came to my rescue (although I first had to suffer for 3 days waiting for it to arrive).I have it on full blast with the heat turned up to 70. No more dry throat and no more dry skin!It`s got a huge water tank and I only have to refill it once a day. Very easy to use.

675793,2017 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Much better electric unit than 1 gallon size;I had to put salt in the 1 gallon one, plus it didn`t steam that well with salt. It wouldn`t steam with iodized salt, which someone recommended in their review; sea salt worked, but I was always concerned that I would either use too much salt and would have problems, not to mention the electric unit that comes with the 1 gallon size has to be cleaned a lot because I had to use salt.THIS 1 1/2 gallon size steams very well without adding salt. I use it for 12 hours and still have plenty of water left. My small apartment gets very cold and DRY. This warms up the air without me having to turn my heater on AND keeps my facial skin from drying out in the winter and dry weather. I paid a bit less for the 1 1/2 gallon size...go figure, which has a better electric unit.",5

I decided to try a different brand. I bought a Vicks and this one is still working so far and its been past a year so far so good. I had purchased one exactly like this one at Walmart that is still working. I ordered this one for another room. As soon as I took it out of the box, I noticed the mist doesnt come out as easily or good as the other one I purchased. I turned it on high and the mist started coming out. The other Vicks will come out even in lower setting, so I believe this one is slightly defective but it works on high so I just run it in high. I didnt want to deal with shipping it back.

The bad news first: this humidifier really doesnt hold a candle to our other humidifier, or even to a prior generation of Vicks humidiers. Thats a disappointment.

To be safe on furniture I am using a towel (suggested in video on another review) and checking the towel each morning. Nothing is leaked while in use which is a positive.

It also only runs about half the night before the auto shut-off kicks in--regardless of how much water is left in it. And the nightlight is a joke. It`s a tiny light that only glows enough that you don`t trip over it in the night. It doesn`t help you see more than a couple of inches from the light. Still, it works great 60% of the time . . .

The tie that holds the cord together was wet and brown, the cord itself smelled like mildew and was covered in gunk. There was a dead moth inside the handle area, and when I opened the water tank it smelled so strong of mildew I should have stopped there however I did not and discovered the heating element was COVERED with build up. My local store just updated their building and added ALOT of new things so Im not sure what has happened, if they used their budget and are now pulling stuff that was brought back, if they are using over stalk from a wear house that had a leak!

668051,2018 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I bought this humidifier to replace a much smaller off-brand one that was in my son`s bedroom that I thought was no longer working (turned out to be user error, but I digress). For a &quot;mini&quot; humidifier this has a great capacity. I keep it set in the midhigh-range for the mist output and I only have to refill it every other day at most when kept on 24 hours a day. That`s fantastic as the old one needed to be refilled after only one night. Also, I have noticed quite an improvement in my son`s health. He had his tonsils and adenoids out, and tubes put in his ears in the Spring. Since we switched to this humidifier over the last month or so he`s had no cough or stuffy nose!So, Pros:-Good capacity-Large opening for filling/cleaning-Works well-Does not seem to gurgle loudlyCons:-Makes a humming noise that is louder than our previous humidifier (this does not seem to bother my son). It is not obscenely loud, more of a low level white noise. For some people this might not be an issue at all; for me I like silence when I sleep. Obviously it is going to make some noise, but I find this a little louder than I`m used to.-Already cleaning mildew off of it. It has been easy to wipe up with a clorox wipe, but it seems like I shouldn`t have to do that yet. I don`t think it`s avoidable, though.-&quot;Mini&quot; is misleading. It is certainly smaller than the regular sized Vicks Cool mist Humidifier (I have that one as well) but compared to my previous small humidifier (I believe it was labeled &quot;personal humidifier&quot;) this one is easily twice the size. Since it can go so long between refills this is not a problem for me, but if you have a tight space and you are looking for something small, this might be bigger than you anticipate. Certainly look at the dimensions.Generally, I am happy with this purchase. I would consider buying it again if my other humidifiers go up.",5

672949,2017 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I haven`t owned a Vicks personal steam inhaler before this one but I did own a different one. There are things I like about each. What I like most about the Vicks model is how you can hold it up to your face and inhale the steam. The plastic face protector fits perfectly around the face and I didn`t feel like the steam was burning me at all. On the other model I used I felt like it would sometimes if I got too close. The Vicks mode doesn`t heat up as quickly. Also, the face protector comes off too easily. If I put any pressure at all on it it would start to come off. That was what I liked least. Only one Vicks pad is necessary for a full effect with the Vicks. It is very strong and very effective. I had a terrible headache when I started this tonight. I had put an ice bag on my head, taken pain medicine and had lain in a dark room for a couple of hours trying to feel better. I then remembered this and decided to give it a try. It absolutely worked. When I was done, my headache was dissipating and was gone before long. If you use a heater a lot, this is also great to moisturize those dry nasal passages. This is a fantastic product and is worth purchasing if you have sinus issues or get headaches. It is very soothing and I am so thankful I have it. There is a notch on the side you can move back and forth to adjust the steam level coming out - I like mine to get as much as possible so I leave it open so as much can come through as possible. It`s easy to move it around because it moves too easily and your hands will hit it while holding the unit during treatment. Make sure you watch out for that. The instructions say you can use tap water for it - I won`t because ours is very bad and I don`t want to inhale it. I just put bottled water and it doesn`t take too much. What I like most about this product is that it works. It alleviates sinus symptoms and helps with my dryness and headaches. That`s worth so much to me.",4

If I put salt in the water it did give a little more steam, but lasted even less hours. But, the thing that I was most disappointed in was the color of the water that was left in the reservoir. It was black, dirty water with small specks of black floating in it. My first thought was, how can it be healthy to breath dirty water. So, even though it was brand new, I did a cleaning according to directions. Next night, same thing. I am past my return window otherwise it would be going back.",1

1213835,2022 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Barely steams. Even if you follow directions. And it flakes off black stuff into water,1
676186,2017 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,thank you keep up the great work,5
672092,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I was expecting it to put out more steam.,3

1214743,2022 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I bought one of these over a year ago when I was really sick and had a dry cough. It provided so much relief and really pumps the water into the air fast.We just moved to a new place in the desert and it is DRY. Even with our bedroom doors closed and it on high, we can barely get the humidity to around 27%-35%. I have a TempStick to track it.It uses about a gallon per day. I only us distilled water in it. Every so often I wipe down the inside to keep it clean.Ive put it outside once with a cap full of bleach to sanitize it. Its pretty great though. Ive gotten used to the sounds but it did keep me up for a little bit.When we dont turn it on we sleep terribly from how dry it is. Pretty worth it!",5
1255615,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Ive only used this humidifier twice and as I was trying to use it last night for my child, it didnt work! I dont even have the box to return it anymore! Im really upset.",1

666004,2019 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,this product is just like the Honeywell but I like this one more for it has vicks pad to put scent out & is has a blue tank. This doesn`t require a filter which can be costly to replace. It does the job so I have no dislikes.,5

677907,2017 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I really like the humidifier. I purchased for my boy`s room to replace the big one with the annoying filter . The intention was to put the old one in my room but now I`m going to just purchase another one of these. Easy set up and maintenance. Wish I bought two to begin with. Got it for less than $30 the first time.,5

677950,2017 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Expensive but wonderful. I saved the pads so I can dab some essential oil in it.,5
676249,2017 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"A great humidifier. Works great and I love that you don`t need filters for this one, as they can get expensive having to replace them so often. This is easily cleaned and is perfect for a single room. I bought this for my grandsons room and it helps him sleep much better and has also helped him with his sinuses. I would highly recommend this humidifier. I like the vapor pads that can be placed in it, they have a very soothing scent that is great for when you have a cold or sinus issues. Great product from Vicks.",5
1046125,2020 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This would work fine for someone able to sit upright. It has to sit on a flat surface while being used and I didn`t see that anywhere in the description. I had purchased it for my bedridden husband. He is only able to get in a reclining position so doesn`t work for him. I may use it sometimes however I also prefer the one we purchased that can be used at an angle.,4
1148116,2021 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This humidifier is incredibly noisy. Sounds like a leaking toilet. Can`t use it in a bedroom because it`s so damn loud.,1
1018054,2020 / 07,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,It is giving more sound than vapor,2
925744,2020 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,It`s quiet and very simple to use. All around great product.,5

1239806,2022 / 08,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Like it,5
663974,2020 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,You must use highly filtered water. I have to use bottled water to reduce the amount of buildup.The device is so hard to clean. Some of the plastic components make no sense. This thing is not designed to be cleaned and gets dirty very fast. You`ll have to clean it every day to two days at best.,2
1254682,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I got the it today and found that it is the used item. There are some water in the tank and dust around it. The worse thing is there is no lid of the tank. How can I use it?!!,1
1048977,2020 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Used it to replace an previous 5 year old model that quit.,5
1134626,2021 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,It is very good!,5

931620,2020 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Best night sleep,5
1087006,2020 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Put out minimal amount of steam. Even after several uses a hot plastic smell is strong. I cleaned the unit numerous times. I would not buy again,1
670839,2019 / 08,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I wouldn`t recommend this. After 3 months of having this and using for only 1 month. It will not work. Steam won`t come out the top anymore. It was only been used for 1 month. They will not let me return. So disappointed we loved it for 1 month. Paid alot for it to only work one month.,1
1243332,2022 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Maybe Im an idiot for not reading the instructionsI put my vapo-pad directly in the water, waited for it to start steaming. Upon steam clouding, I took a huge inhale and the super vicks steam blasted my nostrils with a very potent, condensed menthol vapor bomb. I thought to myself, theres no way this should be this insane (I mean children and the elderly use this) anyway, be sure to place your vapor pad into its slot, not in the waterunless you want to get to parts unknown.",3
1253986,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I have terrible sinus issues. I bought this for myself and I put all sorts of oils etc in it and it works EXCELLENTLY! It is sooooo strong that it fills my entire apartment. I loved it so much that I bought one for my family members and friends who also suffer with sinus issues. They love it as well.,5
672227,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,works well,5
1112327,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I have had this item for less than a year and now it does not work. The on switch does not work. However when it did work it was great. I used it in my bedroom which gets really hot in winter months. The pads are pretty pricy so I emprovised with gauze that I cut to size with few drops of menthol or eucalyptus. On a full tank the mist can last throughout the night into next day. The mist level option is awesome. I really like it would try the warranty option and see what happens....stay tuned.,3
1201279,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Amazing quality.,5
673291,2018 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Love this humidifier. I bought for me however it has cured my husband from snoring!,5
927977,2020 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Doesnt humidify a small/medium room as much as Id like. The light on the front is bright and I use this at night. It does not shut off when runs out of water. Mine made some continual slurping sound for a while after it ran out in the middle of the night. I woke to it making that sound. Was obnoxious. When you go to refill, there is water buildup on the bottom where the funnel meets the base. Leads to drippage when escorting the tank to the sink. I dont know if any of this is normal for humidifiers but its more annoying than it is worth whatever humidity it pumps out.",2
1083777,2020 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I don`t like it,3
669691,2019 / 07,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Worked perfectly for adding humidity to my bedroom in the extremely dry winter months. No more extremely dry nasal passages or dry almost cracking skin in the winter months! Runs very quiet.,5

672112,2017 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This is the worst thing I ever bought from amazon. It`s mask was of mediocre quality, the plastic started melting away. And to top all that internal wiring seemed to have been short circuiting or something and after a strange sound, the whole thing stopped working. Worst of all, no return policy.",1
672806,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Pro`s definitely outweighs the Con`s for this product:Pro`s:1) price point is perfect; i can use one for a year or two, then just toss it instead of trying to clean expensive humidifiers and worry about mold/ mildews 2) I can use tap water!!! I used to use distilled water (you buy them from a store and it`s pain in the neck to transport large quantities of those!) in order to prevent build-ups. 3) It is a STEAM vaporizer- the steam that comes out from the unit is close to the purest form of water regardless how much black gunk you see inside the unit due to mineral deposits on the electrodes that works to create steam! 4) It makes water boiling sound (not quiet) but i think it`s soothing to the point i didnt have to turn on my white noise maker for my 2 year old son.Con`s1) not so pretty- definitely not for the show!2) you will see black gunk in the water (inside)3) you have to figure out how much salt to add depends on how much minerals present in your tab water.Overall, I am satisfied and this is much better than keeping an expensive humidifier which often requires high maintenance. This works for my need. I still have an expensive humidifier from last year in the box which needs a thorough clean up/ change of a filter, etc.",5
1202154,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Use with vaporizer that I purchased from Amazon,5
1213887,2022 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Vapopads are so easy to use and work great in the Vicks humidifiers. I used them every time my family has congestion issues and it helps them sleep much better. They are my go to and I always keep them on hand.,5
1179104,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Bought this for a friend of mine who recently moved to Denver Colorado. Hes was having terrible allergies and sinus problems since moving there. Hes been using it and it has been the greatest thing to help with his allergies and sinus problems. He just loves it,5
927693,2020 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Doesnt produce a lot of steam in my opinion. My humidifier shouldnt show more steam than this thing. Wasnt worth the $46. Would be more worth $25-$30.,3
670542,2019 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I like this stuff. I bought it online because I couldn`t find it in the store. Works well in heated steamer and clears your sinuses. A little pricey though.,4
664357,2020 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Turns off on its own after 30 minuts. Bad design.,1
677895,2017 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Happy with this small humidifier,4
666223,2019 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I like this humidifier because it doesnt use a filter. Easy to clean, I use it daily year round and it has lasted several years.",5
672283,2018 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Really helps when I sleep during the night.,5
669154,2018 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I`m satisfied,5
664589,2020 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Couldnt smell the first one or the replacement. Had to give it a star!,1
1083861,2020 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"According to the box it comes with, this model isn`t necessarily meant for adding humidity to a room. However, I like a lot of others have found it works perfectly for this. I haven`t tried adding vapopacks or anything like that, but it looks easy enough to do. It turns on as soon as it`s plugged in, kind of a pain to turn off at night if it isn`t plugged in nearby. It also says don`t put on a wooden surface- I have it on hard wood floors, and I find the spot where the steam comes out is far enough up that not a lot of condensation actually lands on the floor and saturates it. I`ve had it on for about an hour straight now and there`s no dampness around it. Mine didn`t steam so I had to add some salt to the tank, and I think I`ll add another pinch as I think it might be steaming slowly. But this thing is easy to use, easy to fill, and the cleaning directions look easy to follow.",5
1103015,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"The vicks warm moisture humidifier is great to run when you have a cold or just need some moisture in the air. It is very easy to use. You have a choice to use liquid vicks in the lid part or use the pads. I go back and forth between both. I like that the pads come in different scents, but they can be a bit pricey. I can not stress enough to make sure you are taking the top parts off and cleaning this machine. If you don`t you will end up with hard calcium build up where the water comes out and I know that can`t be good to be breathing in! There are two settings depending on how much mist you want to come out.",4
664215,2020 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This is just what I wanted and needed. It has helped me sleep and my skin is even less dry! I used the little pad that came with it but couldn`t tell a difference when it &quot;ran out.&quot; I highly recommend this Humidifier.,5

1181343,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,The scent is so relaxing! Love it!,5
663966,2019 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Well so far is a NO for me. I spent 39 minutes getting it to steam. I put in the special Vicks liquid that took me well over a week to get and I tried it myself first. Even shut the bedroom door. It steamed for probably 15 min.. idk I went to sleep, but no steam thus morning, no smell of Vicks, yeah.. ummm NO! So Im happy I didnt spend too much. Ill probably box it up and ship it back now that returns are so easy at local dept stores. But it shouldnt be this difficult. Its not like its a new fangled invention. Im glad I didnt trust it will be fine in my childs room. Ill may give it another try, idk, or may take it out behind the barn and use is as a target. Frustrated for sure.",1
1215080,2022 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Completely stopped the gunk problems we were having with out humidifiers!,5
672993,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,It burns your face right away and does not really give much steam. Wanted to return but I could not. Have to find their return policy. This product was way too much expensive for what it is. Very disappointed.,2
1250240,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Holds a good amount of water and is very useful however its quite difficult to unlock to fill with water.,3
665051,2020 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Works fine, helped us when we were really sick.",5
1252682,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Open the box, pull out the fully assembled unit. Remove the top half (the part that says Vicks), turn it upside down, open the port, fill with cold tap water. Optionally: add a few drops of essential oil directly into the water. (I use: 3 drops of Breathe available at Amazon. Ingredients: Peppermint Oil, Eucalyptus Oil, Spearmint Oil, Tea Tree Oil. Alternatively, I use 3 drops of Menthol oil.) Optionally: place a Vicks Vapo Pad in the little door below the on switch. Or, you dont need to do either of those things; just use straight up plain tap water. After adding my essential oil, I close the port, shake the contents, and put the top half back onto the bottom half. What I like is that this is a no-hassle device; the top goes right back onto the bottom, no fussing needed. Next, turn the on switch all the way to the right for 100%, and immediately cool mist comes out of the opening at the top. Its aimed at an angle so as not to hit your wall or ceiling; make sure it doesnt hit your tall furniture either. Put something underneath in case of a spill (I have mine in a glass pie pan). Adjust the mist volume to where you like it. Put your face up to it and inhale. Ahhh. Sit back and let it fill your room. The unit will shut itself off when its empty. Its completely silent.",5

1201553,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I was hoping the plastic smell would go away after a few days, but it has not. My wife says this product is not usable. Amazon says it is not returnable even though I received it only 4 days ago.",1
1206830,2022 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,It is nice because you do not have to plug it in. But the water gets cold fast and you have to keep reheating.,3
674540,2018 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"So far, so great! I have only had the machine for a couple of weeks but I have really benefited from having it. It arrived just as I was getting a head cold and provided a lot of relief. The machine feels sturdy and super easy to use. Time will tell if the durability, but so far I have no complaints:)",5
1142614,2021 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Works great,5
1252195,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Yes - it works as a humidifier. Well, kinda. But the design is awful. Its a bulky tank. And its nearly impossible to empty all the water out. Weve had these floaties on the bottom (which likely came from the filter) that are impossible to get out. Were always left with a bit of old, stale water at each refill - the tank doesnt drain properly. Plus its difficult to clean. Its impossible to rinse out the old water and debris with this space ship container. Save yourself the headache - get another humidifier. But if you like the same old water and stuff floating around in the tank, buy this one.",3

949822,2020 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Excellent product. Very easy to use, clean and fill. Whole tank last about 3 days in using it for 8 hours periods. Most of the time I use it during the night, and has been fantastic. Very nice mist and pretty silent. My synus have been a lot better since starting using this humidifier. Turn it to max and there was no condensation around the base or tank. Althought I recommend to place a towel under just in case. 100% recommended.",5

1061413,2020 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"The product works fine. However, I bought it for while Im sleeping, so the constant sound of trickling water and the slightly high-pitched hum it makes while running drives me insane so I cant sleep with it on, which defeats the purpose. I wish it had a fan sound to it instead like every other humidifier Ive ever owned.",3
677328,2017 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Well designed and has a filter to remove minerals from the water so there`s no white powder and no need to buy distilled water.,5

674277,2018 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Works when needed!,5
1084138,2020 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Very weak misting levels.,3
927150,2020 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Love that it is filter free. Hate that the mist makes everything wet. Returning it for a mist free humidifier,2
669070,2019 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,As described,5
1218892,2022 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,It was nice and quiet at first and then it got loud all of a sudden and I couldn`t bear to leave it on especially while sleeping,2
675506,2017 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"The bottom handle isn`t sturdy enough, it`s only glued on it breaks off. I dropped a full tank of water on my hardwood floor, it shattered into pieces and water spilled all over the place. Otherwise product worked for 3 years.",3
1180042,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Helped breathing during a dry time with electric heating.,5
671085,2019 / 07,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Bought two of these. We like them and would buy again.The reason for the four stars: they are made in China. I don`t like most of the cheap stuff that are made in China, but this is one item that is ok.",4
1165854,2021 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Loving this humidifier!! It lasts so long and really provides a calmness to the room. Would highly recommend,5
1086714,2020 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"After only 2 weeks of use: humidifier suddenly switched from high setting to low on its own. It then made a popping noise, switched back to high and a strong smell of burnt plastic filled the room. I immediately shut off the device and unplugged. I will be throwing this unit away as it is past my return window now and dont feel it is safe to keep running. This is the 3rd machine like this Ive purchased and all have had issues. My children like the night light feature and the noise level so thats why I keep purchasing. I will be finding something different now.",1
931484,2020 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Didnt fit in the opening of my tank,1
672961,2018 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Don`t leave it on a wooden surface. I ruined my hardwood floors with this while I was pregnant. Even with a towel underneath it. Put it on a nightstand- same thing. Finally I had to put it on top of 4 towels and a plastic tupperware lid on a chair before I stopped ruining furniture just to run it.,3
952786,2020 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Opened it up and used it for the first time this week. Worked great for a week and a half then just stopped producing steam.,1
1124429,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This warm steam vaporizer worked amazing in my bedroom. I was congested with a sinus infection and my nose was clogged up. I turned the vaporizer on with the liquid Vicks in the water and within an hour I could feel it working. I was able to breathe again and taste my food.,4
1126555,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This product is trash. I got this product twice and both did the same thing. I placed it on my night stand on a cutting board should incase it decided to leak like the first one it wouldn`t mess my night stand up. Ofc it leaked and not only that I was still congested throughout the night, it made it`s little noises but as for me 0 stars would not recommend",1
673029,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Affordable and effective. Helped my one year sleep better through the night. He had the flu and had a stuffy nose.,5
1200376,2022 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"This humidifier stopped working out of nowhere--one night it was fine and the next it won`t turn on. Super disappointing, especially since it broke a few weeks after the return window closed. Overall disappointing quality.",1
672920,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Piece of junk. Runs for five minutes and keeps cutting off.,1
674468,2018 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I did hear good reviews of this and can state it is a good quality build.Easy to fill with water, easy to place tank on stand, auto shutoff etc.But, such a tiny puff of steam.I just had the ballon sinuplasty surgery and need to keep my sinuses dry. To me, even sitting next to my bed I couldn`t feel any effect. All it really did was make the room hotter but after 8 hours. My nose/sinuses couldn`t tell anything different vs sleeping without this thing.",1
1251834,2022 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Bonne efficacit,5
1169738,2021 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"The lid is not strong and durable. Within 4 weeks of use at the rate of two days a week, it is loose and not in place. The Vicks scent is no longer effective and maybe the poor fit is the cause. Not sure how to proceed.",1
667699,2018 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Easy to use, works well",4
669219,2019 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,UPDATE: Amazon quickly sent me a new humidifier and it works great! Definitely worth the money.This humidifier barely puts out any steam. Not sure if mine is broken or if thats just how it is. Ordered a replacement to find out. Will update review when received.,4
669692,2019 / 07,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Not strong,5
1161626,2021 / 08,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Leaks and non returnable. Waste of money.,1
674071,2018 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I leave my product going all the time ... its essential here in the Pennsylvania winter.,5
673975,2018 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Exactly what we expected.,5
678434,2017 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,did not heat water no steam .,1
675948,2017 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Very cheaply made. Plastic cracked on picking up the water container. It also leaks.,2
663935,2019 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"It is easy to clean and very quiet. Adjustable setting for mist so you can use overnight and not get too much. I added a felt pad with essential oils to scent the air. The little Vicks pad is effective but those are pricey. Would be a little better if they`d send someone to the house to clean it for me, tho...",5
669087,2019 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Installed a new furnace, waking up with headaches, suffering with congestion, even had the flu for the first time in a decade! Learned that dry air in your home causes dehydration (headaches) and a prime environment for germs and bacteria to thrive. Bought two of the Vicks Humidity Monitors to become more aware of the moisture levels in our primary living spaces. The monitors are easy to read, helpful, and includes room temperature as well. Already recommended to a friend.",5
675075,2018 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I haven`t spent the night coughing since I bought this. It`s been a lifesaver. I wish it had an on/off switch but it`s not even close to a deal breaker.,5
1031011,2020 / 08,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I use it for the baby who has trouble sleeping when his asthma bothers him.,5
665101,2019 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I like this humidifier, except for the light, but it died two years later, with winter only use. That seems like a relatively short amount of time.",4
1072117,2020 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"In the past I have used the bowl type of vaporizer. While effective, they are difficult to clean. They leave little black remnants from the electrical contacts and minerals from the water. This is much safer for children. There is not a large stream of steam coming from the spout. Also you can clearly see the amount of water left.I have been using distilled water, so I cannot comment on how easy it is to clean.The only negative I have is that there is a night light on the unit. There is no option to turn it off. So if you need dark in your room to sleep, you will need to turn side with the switch toward the wall or in some way cover the rotary switch.",4
1085697,2020 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Works well. Water reservoir large enough to last overnight. Quiet.,5
1105753,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Functional, space saving, perfect for 9 hours of operation",5
671469,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Works pretty well. I need to put a pinch of salt to get the process started. Also, it needs to be cleaned fairly often.",4
1084998,2020 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Works well and arrived like it said it would. Undamaged and packaged properly,4
1085158,2020 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,the aroma only lasts a couple hours..,2
1254622,2022 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Ive had this for over 2 years, someone else mentioned it in the reviews but PUT SALT OR IT WILL NOT WORK, I REPEAT USE SALT IN THE WATER!!!!!",5
678385,2017 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Works great, I have one at home still working after three years. I bought this one for my daughter in college who keeps getting bloody and it has helped.",5
678574,2017 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,It doesn`t work and we only used it twice.,1
671760,2017 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,If you want to wake up with a brain freeze buy a cool mist humidifier. Personally I did not like how this one made me feel. Invest in a warm mist humidifier especially in the winter. Will make you feel so much better.,1
671844,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Works great! Great humidifier.,5
669771,2019 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Works awesome but my cat loves to knock it over,4
675019,2018 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Shipping time was great. I purchased this for my kitten that had a head cold. It helped a great deal. About 3 weeks after plugging it in, my kittens would not stop meowing after 30 minutes in the bathroom with the humidifier. When I got in to check on them less than an hour of plugging it in, my counters, toilet seat and floor were soaking wet. I didn`t over fill the humidifier and used only as instructed. The black on the bottom was not an issue but I will not use it again due to the mess that it left and now a safety concern. I am not sure if this is an authentic Vicks product or a knock off. I have never had an issue like this with a humidifier, especially Vicks.",2
1213486,2022 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I don`t like how it cant use the vicks pads but it`s still a great product.,5
675112,2018 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"works well, only issue I have is that the mask dosen`t clip into place and can fall off.",4
1105454,2021 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Even when you adjust it to max steam, there is very little steam. It does heat up so its like breathing it warm wet air., but taking a shower works better. Don`t need the vapor scent pads to use it but nice they have a nice scent.",4
925651,2020 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Stops prodicing steam when 1/2 empty wont make it through an 8 hr night,2
1135045,2021 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"The green light is bright, no way I could sleep with this on anywhere in the room. The scent is not very strong either. Disappointed.",2
1113122,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Loved this! This product helped me so much when I used it in my hand help sinus vaporizer! Unlike the shower bath bombs, this is definitely worth the money.",5
668262,2019 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This has proven to be a great product. Easy to clean and fill.,5
673141,2018 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"water tank full of black stuff after every use, concerned about safety. Dont buy",1
1127379,2021 / 03,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Very much liking this,4
669725,2019 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Yeah its easy to install and set up but can hear a loud winding noise when plugged in and doesnt really &quot;work&quot; well. If working is what you wanna call it. Didnt help at all.,1
1188879,2022 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Love it,5
1226195,2022 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Normas did not leave a review,5
677241,2017 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I love it, works great, and helps me sleep better.",5
667794,2019 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"A lifesaver! Good mist, slim style, great price.",5
673078,2017 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Works ok I guess but it does nothing to resolve congestion but does keep the room cool, knowing what I know now I wouldnt buy it as it has almost no impactwhen in uae but Ill keep trying to see if it improves",3
664868,2019 / 11,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I almost didn`t buy this vaporizer because of poor reviews. I have very hard water and was afraid it would clog. It was the only one at my local Walmart so went ahead and purchased it. It`s been two months and so far so good. Even though the minerals build up between cleanings, I`ve had no trouble removing them. I do use filtered water from my tap. I usually run it on the lowest settings and it gives off a wonderful mist. I live in a very dry climate and noticed a difference in my skin in just a few days.",5
1225389,2022 / 06,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This machine does not let out enough steam. Youd be better off boiling water on low. I dont recommend it.,2
674951,2018 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,This product stopped working after one week of use. I didnt set it up until last week and now Im outside of the return window. Do not suggest this item,1
1169721,2021 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Excellent product,5
1218991,2022 / 05,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Waste of money. It doesnt do anything but sit in the water.,1
675474,2017 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Much less expensive than the product advertised on TV. Not as portable, but does the same job.",5
668683,2018 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I needed to re[place a similar, similarly priced humidifier that stopped working. I wanted the maximum output rate available from similar machines. Typically they gave information about tank capacity and refill frequency, but if that`s supposed to be a trustworthy way to deduce rate, why don`t they do the division? In fact this is slower than the smaller unit it replaced, which was already slower than I would have preferred. It is totally quiet and the tank is heavier when full than I want to lift across the kitchen counter to the pass-through where it sits.",3
675017,2018 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"best humidifier!... Ive owned it for about 3 years now and still works as new. When you fill the tank with water then place it on the bottom base you may think it will spill but it totally won`t! My nephews came from out of town and were completely sick and this humidifier helped them breathe at night. My sister was amazed of how well it worked she ditched hers and went out to buy this one. I love the vicks pads you can place in it, I find that two pads work better. If you have the setting on high it will make your room extremely humidified (if that makes sense). I recommend putting the humidifier on the medium setting.",5
668175,2018 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Love this! I like that you can turn the spout to go in any direction.,5
1046792,2020 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"Really low noise, visible mist... works well in a 20x20 room.",5
676547,2017 / 01,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I`ve had this for about a month and half (as of mid Jan, 2017). I bought it for use while sleeping because I was consistently waking up with a bloody nose due to the dryness in my bedroom. I can`t actually see any steam coming out of this, though once it`s been on for a few minutes, water droplets form where the steam is supposed to come out, so clearly it`s working. No more waking up to a bloody nose!- Mineral build-up: I`ve been using filtered water (Brita, and then a filter connected to my sink faucet), and I haven`t noticed any built up of minerals yet.- Leaking: I also haven`t noticed any leaking. It`s been great!- Area coverage: Some reviewers were disappointed that this wasn`t adequate for humidifying an entire level. I would agree that it is definitely only good for one room, though I`m not disappointed by this. The size and capacity of the tank clearly limit it`s spread.- Auto-off: while running, the light around the dial is green. When the water runs out, the unit makes a soft clicking noise once, and then the light turns orange. I`ve had it in this auto-off status for almost 6 hours straight and it`s been fine. I just make sure to turn the dial back to off when I notice it.",5
1134955,2021 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I honestly feel like this was used sent back and than was sent to me it was dirty water stains on it I can`t even send it back because I don`t have the freaking box anymore,1
926257,2020 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,I got two free pads with my humidifier which lasted a few days after use. These pads only seem to last a few hours disappointing,2
1179010,2021 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Product stopped working within 24 hours of having it. The fan no longer turned on. Rating it one star is being kind,1
1134104,2021 / 04,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,"I bought this for my mom bc she was having very bad phlegm and after a week she`s been waking up with a clear throat and sinuses. Her favorite vicks `flavor` is the lavender pad. The only thing I would be careful with is the cleaning, make sure its cleaned after every use bc the water sits and the machine gets yellow.",5
1248095,2022 / 10,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,It just smells great scents my room all day !,5
669792,2019 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Let me share some engineering here: I tear new stuff apart. I wore out the first Vicks and tried a Sunbeam. All from Walmart. Can`t beat the price. Vicks has 2 `carbon` rods that shed black flakes but clear water. Sunbeam was supposed to have stainless steel. Not 304 grade non magnetic and rusty water. I went back to Vicks. I`m happy. Thanks Walmart`s. SSJ*,5
1165545,2021 / 09,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Not as expected,2
925299,2020 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Im disabled with a bad back neck and shoulders and right knee. The pain keeps me awake at night. This product helps calm down the nerves.,5

927294,2020 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,It works great for me. I dont need much space to humidify. My water is bad so I do have to clean it often because I dont want to fill it with drinking water I buy. If I fill it when I get home from work it lasts all night.,5
668054,2018 / 12,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,The fish cleaning pebbles that were recommended for this model do not fit in the opening..very disappointing,3
1111267,2021 / 02,HUMIDIFICATION-PHARMACY,Excellent machine. Had a machine just like it that lasted 10 years with semi-regular use. New one works great.,5
